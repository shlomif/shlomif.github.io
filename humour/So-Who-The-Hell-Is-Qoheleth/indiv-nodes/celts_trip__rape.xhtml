I never ventured a long way past Damascus.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Sure! It was very interesting. Most interesting.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> We travelled with our own people and some Greek merchants, all the way to Athens, and there we hitchhiked a ride with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people">Assyrian</a> merchants, hoping it will get us closer to Alexandria. There were some guards escorting us, and at one point they disarmed us and threatened us at sword&#8217;s point to have sex with them or else they'll kill us and take all our possessions.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Wow! Rape. So what did you do?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Well, we consulted between ourselves and after a long while of being really scared, we calmed down a little, and decided that if we are forced to have sex, we might as well cooperate and try to enjoy it. So we told them that we&#8217;ll do it willingly, and they agreed.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> How clever of you! And then what happened?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Well, the three of us and her lover each found their own part of the woods, and we had sex. Then, after one or two times, the three men all lost stamina, while we were not completely satisfied and cried for more!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Josephus laughs. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Alexis:</strong> Yes! Then we heard each other&#8217;s cries and we gathered at one place together still naked with our clothes as cover, and we bitched about the whole situation - in Greek - and the men stood there ashamed.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Yes! Anyway, we continued as couples throughout the trip and the men got better in love making as time went by, and they also taught us a little Aramaic. Then we arrived at the junction - they wanted to go to Assyria, and we wanted to head more south, and then all the 6 of us were completely emotional and offered each other to escort them on the way, so we won&#8217;t part. But we eventually cared enough about the others to let them go on their own way.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Wow! That sounds like love.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Love! Yes! That&#8217;s the word. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros">Eros</a> in action.</p></div></section></main>
