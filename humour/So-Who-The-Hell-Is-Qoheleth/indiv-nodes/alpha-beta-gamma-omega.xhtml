See, I give my own associations based on the cards, and instead of telling what I think they mean, I ask you what they mean.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Sounds relatively innocent. Well, I have sinned enough since I wrote the scroll, and if God has mercy on my soul, maybe I&#8217;ll still live long enough.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Yes. OK, let&#8217;s start. <span class="inlinedesc">[ Puts a card. ]</span> I&#8217;ll call this card &#8220;The Alpha&#8221; - what does it mean to you?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> the Alpha&#8230; I&#8217;m reminded of some philosophers who studied biology who discussed the herds of some animals, where there was an alpha male who mates with all the females.

Yes! The most coveted female&#8230; Phoebe &#8230; a rule breaker&#8230; keeps challenging social norms&#8230; the &#8220;bad girl&#8221;&#8230; gets into a lot of trouble, but usually not remotely in danger - she can get out of it.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Image - anthology of alpha females: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alicia_Silverstone">Alicia Silverstone</a>, SMG, Natalie Portman, Miley Cyrus, Paris Hilton and Jennifer Lawrence. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Yes, in stories or plays she is usually the antagonist.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selena:</strong> Or he.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Indeed. Or he.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> OK, next.

Hmmm&#8230; Let me think&#8230;</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Yes! The &#8220;protagonist&#8221;, the good girl, solid, &#8220;responsible adult&#8221;. She&#8217;s more respected than the Alpha female, and some men find her more attractive. She&#8217;s featured in conversations less, and people assume there&#8217;s a rivalry between her and the Alpha female.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> In Damascus&#8217; case, it is the Princess. She&#8217;s already engaged, and her marriage may make her the Beta female emerita, but only time can tell. She and I flirted a few times since I published &#8220;Qoheleth&#8221;.
