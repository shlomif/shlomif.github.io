He can see through the hood that her face is pale and that she has sunburns. She takes him to a restaurant which is shaded, and there are two other girls there: one blonde and the other with red/orange coloured-hair. They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts">Celts</a> .</p><p>The other girl (Athena) pulls down her hood, and she is blonde as well. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Hello Josephus, thanks for coming to meet us. We are three Celtic girls from the village near the salt mine in the alps. We wanted to travel all the way to Alexandria, but given our sunburns, I guess that&#8217;s not going to happen.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> My Greek name is Athena. This is Selena, and Alexis. Will you care for some wine or grape juice? Kosher of course, not that we&#8217;ll ever willingly drink the non-kosher excuses for them again.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Nice to meet you all. I wish there was something I could do to prevent or fight these sun-burns of yours, but unfortunately, our practice of medicine is not so advanced yet. In general, we believe you should stay in the shade, and get plenty of fluids.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> From what I read about your people, you tend to be predominantly blond, and I also notice that Selena is a redhead. Is it common there?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Oh, yes, quite common. From what we noticed, here it tends to be extremely rare.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Yes, King David was reportedly a <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-12.htm">&#8220;Reddish and with beautiful eyes&#8221;</a> , which indicates that back when that scripture was written, it was notable, but not unthinkable.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Anyway, right now, I only have two Jewish redhead relatives: my cousins - a boy and a girl.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> And what happened to them?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Oh, what happened to the girl cousin is a really interesting story. See: there's this other girl - Greek, black hair, brown eyes, bronze skin - actually she's the younger sister of the guy who challenged me to write the scroll - and a very rebellious character. She&#8217;s been making a lot of philosophers here angry with her offputting comments, and nearly got herself killed or injured several times.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selena:</strong> &#8220;Nearly&#8221;&#8230; &#8220;nearly&#8221; is the key word.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Yes, possibly. Anyway, although certainly pretty, I&#8217;ve known far more beautiful girls here, but, but&#8230; men go mad over her! She&#8217;s been courted by princes and by some of the richest merchants, and&#8230; philosophers wrote many love songs praising and idealising her beauty. And that bitch doesn&#8217;t accept any of her suitors.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> And so did my good Greek friend, Alexander, who started by writing some poems to her which I didn&#8217;t like, and told him why. So he ended up improving slowly but surely, until he wrote a truly great poem about her, and people loved it.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Then Phoebe &#8212; that&#8217;s her name &#8212; told him, while crying, that she loved the song, but that she still is not going to marry him.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Alexis:</strong> The Bitch!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> My thoughts exactly. Anyway, he felt very down for a long while, so I decided to introduce him to my redhead cousin - her name&#8217;s Elishevah - hoping it&#8217;ll cheer him up. He ended up liking her and he wrote a hack of that song as a love song to her, and she ended up falling in love with him, and he converted to Judaism and married her, and she&#8217;s now pregnant with their first born, and he writes more songs about her. Very good ones.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> And Phoebe is still single?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Yes! And people are still crazy over her.</p></div></section></main>
