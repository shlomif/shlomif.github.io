Told you! All Jews are the same. Jehovah, Jehovah, Jehovah.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Selena:</strong> Well, just for the record, we&#8217;re not going to have sex with you either.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Oh.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus&#8217; Voice:</strong> I actually felt disappointed.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Do you feel disappointed from it?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Me? No! It&#8217;s actually a relief. Well&#8230; a little.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> OK, just know that it&#8217;s nothing personal: we decided against having sex completely, shortly after hearing your Qoheleth thing.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Really? But didn&#8217;t I say <a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/poly/ecc011.htm">Young man, be joyful in your youth</a> there?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> That you did, but something else there made us realise that sex is not worth the risk of getting pregnant. So we&#8217;re going to wait with it until we return home to our village.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> I see, I said so many things in the scroll that I couldn&#8217;t tell what was right and what was wrong. Good thing I admitted it was blasphemy and should not be taken seriously.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Yes, well, we actually started learning the Jewish law and legacy from some priests in the Jewish and Phoenician convoy hoping we can eventually convert to Judaism and marry the Jewish men. A lot of it seems nifty and a lot seems quite appalling. Are all the mythologies of the peoples here like that?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> There are many parallels, and most myths of the Jews exist in various variations in the myths of other nations. Ever since the exile to Babylon, the Jews have treated their Torah as holy, which I sometimes feel was not the original intention of these stories.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> The storytellers of the Jews or the other people were essentially a precursor to modern-day philosophers, and I feel that a good story reflects some good philosophy. I&#8217;m pretty sure many of the stories in the Torah and the books of the Prophets were passed by and embellished from generation to generation.</p></div></section></main>
