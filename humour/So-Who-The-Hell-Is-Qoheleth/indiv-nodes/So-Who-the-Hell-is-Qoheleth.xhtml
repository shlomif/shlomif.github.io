He can see through the hood that her face is pale and that she has sunburns. She takes him to a restaurant which is shaded, and there are two other girls there: one blonde and the other with red/orange coloured-hair. They are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celts">Celts</a> .</p><p>The other girl (Athena) pulls down her hood, and she is blonde as well. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Hello Josephus, thanks for coming to meet us. We are three Celtic girls from the village near the salt mine in the alps. We wanted to travel all the way to Alexandria, but given our sunburns, I guess that&#8217;s not going to happen.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> My Greek name is Athena. This is Selena, and Alexis. Will you care for some wine or grape juice? Kosher of course, not that we&#8217;ll ever willingly drink the non-kosher excuses for them again.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Nice to meet you all. I wish there was something I could do to prevent or fight these sun-burns of yours, but unfortunately, our practice of medicine is not so advanced yet. In general, we believe you should stay in the shade, and get plenty of fluids.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> From what I read about your people, you tend to be predominantly blond, and I also notice that Selena is a redhead. Is it common there?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Oh, yes, quite common. From what we noticed, here it tends to be extremely rare.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Yes, King David was reportedly a <a href="http://biblehub.com/1_samuel/16-12.htm">&#8220;Reddish and with beautiful eyes&#8221;</a> , which indicates that back when that scripture was written, it was notable, but not unthinkable.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Anyway, right now, I only have two Jewish redhead relatives: my cousins - a boy and a girl.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> And what happened to them?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Oh, what happened to the girl cousin is a really interesting story. See: there's this other girl - Greek, black hair, brown eyes, bronze skin - actually she's the younger sister of the guy who challenged me to write the scroll - and a very rebellious character. She&#8217;s been making a lot of philosophers here angry with her offputting comments, and nearly got herself killed or injured several times.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selena:</strong> &#8220;Nearly&#8221;&#8230; &#8220;nearly&#8221; is the key word.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Yes, possibly. Anyway, although certainly pretty, I&#8217;ve known far more beautiful girls here, but, but&#8230; men go mad over her! She&#8217;s been courted by princes and by some of the richest merchants, and&#8230; philosophers wrote many love songs praising and idealising her beauty. And that bitch doesn&#8217;t accept any of her suitors.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> And so did my good Greek friend, Alexander, who started by writing some poems to her which I didn&#8217;t like, and told him why. So he ended up improving slowly but surely, until he wrote a truly great poem about her, and people loved it.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Then Phoebe &#8212; that&#8217;s her name &#8212; told him, while crying, that she loved the song, but that she still is not going to marry him.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Alexis:</strong> The Bitch!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> My thoughts exactly. Anyway, he felt very down for a long while, so I decided to introduce him to my redhead cousin - her name&#8217;s Elishevah - hoping it&#8217;ll cheer him up. He ended up liking her and he wrote a hack of that song as a love song to her, and she ended up falling in love with him, and he converted to Judaism and married her, and she&#8217;s now pregnant with their first born, and he writes more songs about her. Very good ones.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> And Phoebe is still single?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Yes! And people are still crazy over her.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-the_celts_trip_to_damascus"><header><h3 id="the_celts_trip_to_damascus">The Celts Trip to Damascus</h3></header><section class="scene" id="scene-celts_trip__rape"><header><h4 id="celts_trip__rape">The Rape</h4></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Anyway, can you share some details about your trip? I never ventured a long way past Damascus.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Sure! It was very interesting. Most interesting.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> We travelled with our own people and some Greek merchants, all the way to Athens, and there we hitchhiked a ride with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people">Assyrian</a> merchants, hoping it will get us closer to Alexandria. There were some guards escorting us, and at one point they disarmed us and threatened us at sword&#8217;s point to have sex with them or else they'll kill us and take all our possessions.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Wow! Rape. So what did you do?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Well, we consulted between ourselves and after a long while of being really scared, we calmed down a little, and decided that if we are forced to have sex, we might as well cooperate and try to enjoy it. So we told them that we&#8217;ll do it willingly, and they agreed.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> How clever of you! And then what happened?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Well, the three of us and her lover each found their own part of the woods, and we had sex. Then, after one or two times, the three men all lost stamina, while we were not completely satisfied and cried for more!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Josephus laughs. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Alexis:</strong> Yes! Then we heard each other&#8217;s cries and we gathered at one place together still naked with our clothes as cover, and we bitched about the whole situation - in Greek - and the men stood there ashamed.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Yes! Anyway, we continued as couples throughout the trip and the men got better in love making as time went by, and they also taught us a little Aramaic. Then we arrived at the junction - they wanted to go to Assyria, and we wanted to head more south, and then all the 6 of us were completely emotional and offered each other to escort them on the way, so we won&#8217;t part. But we eventually cared enough about the others to let them go on their own way.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Wow! That sounds like love.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Love! Yes! That&#8217;s the word. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eros">Eros</a> in action.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-celts_trip__non_seducable_jewish_merchants"><header><h4 id="celts_trip__non_seducable_jewish_merchants">The Non-seducable Jewish Merchants</h4></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Anyway, then we hitched a ride with a band of Greek merchants. The boys there were easy and we all liked each other, so we had a lot of sex, and we learned even more Aramaic from them.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Did you fall in love with them too?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> This time we didn&#8217;t. So after them, we hitchhiked a ride with some Jewish and Phoenician merchants. Jews and Phoenicians proclaim to hate each others&#8217; guts but they always band together. Anyway, we wanted to have sex with the Jewish men but they refused to do so unless we converted to Judaism and they married us. They kept citing Jehovah and their faith to him as the reason why.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> So did you give up on them?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Not on your life! We wanted them more! And more badly!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ <img class="screenplay_image" src="../images/Friends-S02E04--Nothing-Sexier.svg.jpg" title="Let me tell you something.

So we&#8217;re going to wait with it until we return home to our village.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> I see, I said so many things in the scroll that I couldn&#8217;t tell what was right and what was wrong. Good thing I admitted it was blasphemy and should not be taken seriously.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Yes, well, we actually started learning the Jewish law and legacy from some priests in the Jewish and Phoenician convoy hoping we can eventually convert to Judaism and marry the Jewish men. A lot of it seems nifty and a lot seems quite appalling. Are all the mythologies of the peoples here like that?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> There are many parallels, and most myths of the Jews exist in various variations in the myths of other nations. Ever since the exile to Babylon, the Jews have treated their Torah as holy, which I sometimes feel was not the original intention of these stories.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> The storytellers of the Jews or the other people were essentially a precursor to modern-day philosophers, and I feel that a good story reflects some good philosophy. I&#8217;m pretty sure many of the stories in the Torah and the books of the Prophets were passed by and embellished from generation to generation.</p></div></section></section><section class="scene" id="scene-girls-doing-warfare"><header><h3 id="girls-doing-warfare">Girls Doing Warfare</h3></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Is it true what they say about the Iranian tribes having female warriors, that were the inspiration for the Amazons of the Greek?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Athena:</strong> Oh them&#8230; well not really.
