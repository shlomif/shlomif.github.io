Are there any news with respect to handling the Pseudo-vampires crisis?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Hi Becky! Well we have some plans and <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/First_Evil">The First</a> told us we'll likely be lucky enough.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Isn't The First being Evil?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Not anymore - during one divination we made him convert to the good side. He realised that being alone for milliards of years does not justify being frustrated for the rest.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Heh, he kinda reminds me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android">Marvin the Paranoid Android</a> .</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Oh, The First is totally psyched about Marvin. He sees him as his soul mate and as someone who shares a similar past. In fact, during many divinations, he recites poems he had written about Marvin and himself. Very emo ones, but they make people laugh, and The First does not seem to mind that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Hey, I also told my older brother, who is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army">U.S. Army</a> soldier about the crisis and he surprisingly didn't think I was delusional, and said he may be able to help us.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Good job, Beck! You have a lot of potential.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Oh, for goodness sake! How much potential can one brony-chick sport?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> by the way, how did you survive on the streets as a girl?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> well, "living on the streets" is kind-of a stretch. See: I took Peter the Mafio's advice and collected money from people in exchange for stand-up comedy/philosophy sessions and earned my keeps this way. Just for the record, being original is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kQCpsPnnew">a Big Mistake</a>; I crossoverred stuff all over the place.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> And after I became a slayer: big money! People will give you <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther">half</a> their life savings for saving their lives. I settled on a quarter at most, heh.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Then after I hit puberty, I used to seduce guys all over the place. And I was below the age of consent so it was fucking illegal!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Fucking illegal fucking!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ They laugh. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Chankey: you've just said the F-word&#8230; I knew you had a lot of potential.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> thanks, Becky! I try.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> God, kill me now!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> anyway, many of my lovers came for more helpings, and surprisingly they never coincided. And there was passion alright. Despite the fact that I did that only to compensate for my mother.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> but there was something strange: I used to have these dreams where I had sex with one or more lover <b class="bold">and</b> one or more characters from TV shows, films, or books. And I never had a m&#233;nage in my life, and you know how dreams during which you have sex are supposed to be good dreams&#8230; these dreams were nightmares!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> strange&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> yes! And after the sex, I saw myself standing in front of my own lookalike, who said "You <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml">know</a>, but you don't know enough."</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> and&#8230; after I came to Sunnydale, I had sex with Xander as part of my master plan for preventing the Ascension, and I felt sorry for him being manipulated like that. So I ended up hanging out with him for a few days. I wouldn't have admitted it back then, but I fell in love with him.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Then I had a dream where we were kissing each other passionately and that time, it was a very pleasant one. And then I saw my lookalike, and she said: &#8220;Now you know more. Keep it up. By the way, my name's <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Eliza_Dushku">Eliza</a>.&#8221;</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> And I never saw her again.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> That's weird!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Yes. Anyway, I taught Xand some martial arts, and surprisingly, he was able to defeat both Buffy and me quite often. We thought it may have to do with our emotional attachment, so we asked Chuck Norris to fight us and he agreed and won too. (He likely thought it was weird that two frail girls asked him that, heh.)</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> So we had to rethink our prejudice against men being slayers&#8230;</p></div></section></main>
