They are also almost all happily married and have young children.</p><p>The future looks bright for the demon fighting world as Rebecca &#8220;Becky&#8221; Shepherd, a slayer wannabe in the 10th grade, as well as Chankey Rajeesh (an Englishman of Indian descent, with photographic memory, who wishes to become a watcher) and Cliff Farrel (an all-American, extremely athletic, warlock/witch-wannabe) become a team, and start studying. ]</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ This text is Copyright by Shlomi Fish, 2014 and is made available under the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution Noncommercial Share-Alike 3.0 Unported Licence (CC-by-nc-sa)</a> (or at your option - any later version). ]</p></div></section></main>
