Something feels wrong.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> The original vampire!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Oz:</strong> Let me find him.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ He casts a spell, and uses the smartphone to locate him. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Oz:</strong> He's in a nearby city, in a building and alone.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ He opens a portal. The gang enters,</p><p>they spot Mark the vampire. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mark:</strong> No, go away now! Run!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[In Latin]</span> Bring my friends and me to sanctuary.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ They all disappear including Mark the vampire and reappear outside. Shortly afterwards they hear and see the roof of the floor where they found Mark crumbling. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Oh my God!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Willow looks around, sees Mark and casts a spell to keep him still. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Good timing on my part - now I&#8217;ll need to recharge this Mana amulet.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Good call, Cliff! You&#8217;ve got a lot of potential too.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Thank you, Ms. Harris. <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/princess_bride/quotes/">I won&#8217;t let it go to my head</a>.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Anyway, my spell was about friends, so how come this vampire is a friend.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Thompson:</strong> Oh! Mark Raymond here used to be a contractor for us back when the Q Continuum of the Selinaverse expanded into our own world, which we&#8217;ll now call the <a href="http://buffyfanfiction.wikia.com/wiki/Beckyverse">Beckyverse</a> <span class="inlinedesc">[cut to Becky - she is blushing]</span> and experimented with a duplicator that they had given us when he became a vampire, stole it, and caused all this trouble.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Willow:</strong> So we&#8217;ll have to restore his soul, and them convert him back into a human? God! That will require some powerful spells and be very time consuming. I&#8217;ll have to research it.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Voice from behind of <a href="http://buffy.wikia.com/wiki/Enyos_of_the_Kalderash">Enyos of the Kalderash</a> ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Enyos:</strong> It will take us about two hours.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Willow turns around. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Willow:</strong> Enyos! Nice to see you again! <span class="inlinedesc">[they hug.]</span></p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Enyos also hugs Buffy and shakes the hands of some of the men. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Willow:</strong> Two hours? Really? How?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Enyos:</strong> Well, we got better with it due to practice. See: following the restoration of Angel here, we figured out we can do the same with other vampires and made a big business out of it.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Willow:</strong> So how much will all this cost?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Enyos:</strong> Special offer for you today at half the price: zero dollars.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> Zero?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Enyos:</strong> Yes! Our business model is different. First of all, we ask the transformed vampires to provide us with a subset of their income as benevolent humans - as much or as little as they want - as a token of their appreciation.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Enyos:</strong> And furthermore, we also use their stories of their lives as vampires as inspiration and fodder for our own franchise of vampire fiction. Some really sick stuff there, but they sell like hotcakes.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Willow:</strong> Lovely! That sounds like an exciting and innovative take on slaying.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Enyos:</strong> Oh, it certainly is. And we&#8217;re willing to share our knowledge and experience with you. For the right consulting price.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Meanwhile, they are already back in Sunnydale. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Awesome! Sounds really cool.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> Alright! Oz, Giles, you escort Mark to Enyos&#8217; clan back in Europe, and learn as much as you can from them about it - we can negotiate a consulting price later on.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> The rest of us need to start the Sunnydale de-evacuation.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Snyder:</strong> Hey there, Buffy. I&#8217;m glad it all worked out in the end. We&#8217;re thinking of doing one of our famous &#8220;open commerce days&#8221; where shops and food and drinks outlets sell goods for as little or as much as the buyer is willing to pay. General, your men are welcome to join the party here as well.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Thompson:</strong> Thank you, Mayor! We&#8217;d love that.</p></div></section></main>
