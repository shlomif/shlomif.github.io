Faith approaches them. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Hmm&#8230; hi kids! That doesn&#8217;t sound exactly like Anna Kendrick.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Whoa, who are all those girls?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Oh, they are Cimorelli - six sisters who sing together. They are a big hit on YouTube.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Six sisters!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> And they also have some brothers.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Heh, God bless their mother. After my third pregnancy (to twins) I said: &#8220;That&#8217;s it. No way, Jos&#233;!&#8221;.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> I would think their being a big family is part of their charm.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Yes, and the way I see it: all the power to them. See: I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twenty_Thousand_Leagues_Under_the_Sea">20,000 Leagues Under the Sea</a> as a child, and I ended up memorising the English translation and now the French original, because I liked it so much.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Anyway, Captain Nemo there, thinks he&#8217;s a nobody, which is what &#8220;Nemo&#8221; means in Latin, but he's not. Thing is: lots of people expressed interest in him due to his various distinctive qualities, and he kept thinking: &#8220;They are interested in tangential stuff, not in the real me. They don't know the real me.&#8221;</p><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> And here's the thing: all these qualities are what make you who you are, and you should exploit them and be yourself.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Indeed!</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Wish I had any sisters. Or brothers for that matter. But I was my mother's only child, and my poor excuse for a father was a U.S. Navy sailor who got drunk along with my mother, they had sex, and the bastard bought her breakfast the day later, gave her his contact details and left.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> They told me it was the only time she ever had sex. <span class="inlinedesc">[Faith starts crying.]</span></p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> When I was 5, my mother was killed by some criminals who spared my life, and we agreed to pretend that I was also killed. So I grew up on the streets.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Then one day when I was 9, I took the bus to one of my city&#8217;s good neighbourhoods where I saw a young boy about my age about 90% of the way out of a book.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut to the scene with the young faith and the young boy (= David). ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Hey homeboy, so this book&#8217;s interesting?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Hi! Yes, it is.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[looks at the book]</span> &#8220;The Three Musketeers&#8221; - think I&#8217;ve heard of it. So it&#8217;s good?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Yes, it&#8217;s great.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[snatches the book]</span> That book&#8217;s mine, bitch!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Hey that&#8217;s OK - you can have it - I&#8217;ll just buy a new one. Bye!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[from the distance]</span> See ya, homeboy.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith&#8217;s internal dialogue:</strong> It took me a day to finish reading the book. I could not put it down. The next day, I decided to return it to the boy.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Hey, bitch, here&#8217;s your book back.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Thank you&#8230;ahem&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Faith! My name&#8217;s "Faith".</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Nice to meet you - I&#8217;m David. I didn&#8217;t buy a new book yet.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> That&#8217;s good, I suppose. Oh, and they end up killing Milady de Winter there.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Really? I positively love her, she&#8217;s amazing.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Agreed. Well, I&#8217;m off to my original hood. <span class="inlinedesc">[She runs.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Faith&#8230; wait!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Farewell, loser.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut to Faith in the Library. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> So I Grew up in the streets, learned to slay vampires and other demons, and &#8212; had sex! Lots of lots of sex. I lost track of the number of guys I seduced, but I still remember each one.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Then I came to Sunnydale, pretended to be evil and ended up saving the day. I then entered a relationship with Xander, and we got married, and raised children&#8230; not to mention that Peter, the Mafio who killed my mother and who hasn't killed anyone since, ended up supporting me, and he also comes to visit me here (and he is close to being a father to me).</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> But&#8230; it&#8217;s not the same.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> There&#8217;s a big hole inside of me&#8230; of not having a proper, happy childhood&#8230;</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> I want my daddy! <span class="inlinedesc">[Bursts out crying harder.]</span></p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Becky walks to her and hugs her.</p><p>After a while Faith calms down a little. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Oh, look at me: Faith, the fierce vampire slayer, crying like a baby! I&#8217;m so pathetic!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Xander:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[From the background of the frame.]</span> Crying does not make you weak. On the contrary - it&#8217;s one way of fighting.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Hey, honey! You remember Becky and Chankey.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Xander:</strong> That I do, Faithy <span class="inlinedesc">[he hugs her]</span>.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Faith puts her head in Xander&#8217;s chest affectionately. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Faith, do you know what happened to that boy&#8230; David?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Yes, I do: he found me on the Internet, a few years back, and we touched base. He&#8217;s happily married plus children and is an expert of Internet marketing and e-Commerce. He came to visit me in Sunnydale, and brought his children with him, and mine got along very nicely with his.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> He brought the copy of <i class="italics">The Three Musketeers</i> that I stole and returned, and asked me if I wanted it. I had my own book that I bought after I came to Sunnydale, but was excited to see the copy in question.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> And finally, he also told me that at the time, his father had been in touch with some couples who were looking to adopt children my age, and they would have been able to find a couple that could have adopted me.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Oh! <span class="inlinedesc">[She has tears in her eyes.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Yes, well, that's all over now I guess.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Bye, kids.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Xander:</strong> Bye Becky, Chankey.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky and Chankey:</strong> Bye Mr. and Ms. Harris!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ They leave. ]</p></div></section></main>
