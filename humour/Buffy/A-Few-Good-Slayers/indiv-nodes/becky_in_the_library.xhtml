It&#8217;s large. The song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4G6QDNC4jPs">&#8220;Everytime We Touch&#8221; by Cascada</a> is playing in the background and people are making other light noises. Becky approaches the librarian, Ms. Chu, who has Oriental looks. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Hi, I would have expected a library to be more quiet than that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Ms. Chu:</strong> Yes, but we realised that such sterility is not good for creativity or for one&#8217;s self-esteem. This song actually was a good catalyst for rethinking our strategy.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Ms. Chu:</strong> Anyway, my name is Diane Chu, and I&#8217;m the librarian here. I&#8217;m also a qualified watcher.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Nice to meet you: I am Becky Shepherd.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Ms. Chu:</strong> Nice to meet you. <span class="inlinedesc">[They shake hands]</span> I think your two team mates are over there.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Why, thank you! I&#8217;m going to join them.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-becky_in_the_library__chit_chat"><header><h4 id="becky_in_the_library__chit_chat">Chit Chat</h4></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Hi Chankey, Cliff.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Hello, Becky. You were right, I have made many friends.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Samantha, who is a good looking white girl, approaches Chankey. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Samantha:</strong> Oh, Chankey, there you are! I had a great time tonight. <span class="inlinedesc">[She kisses him on the cheek.]</span> We&#8217;ll schedule another date using instant messaging, K? See you!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ She leaves. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Ooh... watch it, Mr. Watcher!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cliff hits him with his fist. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Heh, tell me about it. What is it about women and Indian men?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> What is it about women and all exotic men? Or non-exotic ones! Girls here hit on me like crazy, and I&#8217;ve had lots of dates.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Men do that too, by the way. Like&#8230; in Israel, lots of men asked my female friends and I &#8212; where some of them were kinda big, not athletic looking and not very beautiful &#8212; on dates, or hit on us in the typical Israeli &#8220;smooth&#8221; way.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> That&#8217;s not all, but I talked with some female Jewish divorcees, and they told me that many religious married Jewish asked them if they are interested to have an affair with them.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> What? Such an affair? How is this&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Kosher? It is for married men based on the Jewish Law. Not for women though.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Heh, double standards.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Well, that&#8217;s Judaism for you.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Anyway, Orthodox religious Jews are attracted to ethnic Jewesses (like me) like flies are attracted to a piece of meat, because we don&#8217;t have to observe for them to have Jewish children. I had many awesome dates with Yeshivah pupils.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> That&#8217;s great, Brony girl.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Cliff, her name is &#8220;Becky&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> That&#8217;s quite alright. I like being called &#8220;Brony girl&#8221;. It makes me feel special.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> So, Cliff <span class="inlinedesc">[she flicks her hair]</span>, what did you do this summer?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Oh, I spent this time in southern California, doing martial arts, witchcraft and hanging around with friends and celebrities.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Celebrities? Really?!! Which ones?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> You name it - I met Chuck Norris for example and fought against him.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> You met Chuck Norris? That&#8217;s so great! How&#8217;s he like? And who won?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Oh, he&#8217;s great! Keeps saying various aphorisms that I can never tell if they are from the Bible or not, but, ye know, he&#8217;s just being himself.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> And he takes losing (like with me - I won two rounds out of three) amazingly well. Says that he can learn more from a lost fight than from a fight he&#8217;s won.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Awesome!</p><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Anyway, you probably know that <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/">Summer Glau pawns Chuck</a>. She doesn&#8217;t have to hurt you if she doesn&#8217;t want to, while Norris kills everyone in sight. It also takes her a minute to write a rebuttal for a bad blog comment like in <a href="http://xkcd.com/406/">xkcd: &#8220;Venting&#8221;</a>, and she would sign it as him.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Chankey bursts out laughing. Cliff and Becky join him. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Well, I actually met her a few times, including in a fight tournament where she lost one of the first few rounds. She&#8217;s a good fighter, but not that good. Then she saw me fighting, and asked me if we can fight.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Summer Glau asked <b class="bold">you</b> to fight <b class="bold">her</b>? Get out! I&#8217;m not worthy&#8230; I&#8217;m not worthy&#8230; I&#8217;m not worthy&#8230; <span class="inlinedesc">[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5FT3IGXtAk">Reference: Wayne's World</a>]</span></p><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Cliff, you&#8217;re a freaking wizard!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> I&#8217;m a freaking witch! Anyway, I won all three rounds and she told me it was a good fight.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-becky_in_the_library__with_buffy"><header><h4 id="becky_in_the_library__with_buffy">With Buffy</h4></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Of course, everyone knows that Buffy is better than Chuck <span class="inlinedesc">[<a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Buffy/">Buffy Facts</a>]</span>. He&#8217;s been secretly fighting against her, and so far has lost all of those battles.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Yeah, and her gaze can turn Medusa into stone!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Buffy Summers is not afraid of demons. Demons are afraid of her, and for a very good reason.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy&#8217;s voice:</strong> Buffy Summers is always there when people are spreading untrue hyperboles about her.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Oh, hello Ms. Summers.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Buffy approaches them from a different aisle in the library. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> Hello, kids.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> By the way, what is your post-marriage name?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> It&#8217;s &#8220;Summers&#8221;. Angel and I are both called that. He didn&#8217;t find his original family name usable in this day and age, so he adopted mine. His original name was very aristocratic, and he is actually a direct male descendent of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlemagne">Charlemagne</a>.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Ooh&#8230; so you are now Milady de Summers? Awesome!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> Heh, well, it is Faith that has an unnatural obsession with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de Winter</a> &#8212; not me.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> In any case, for your information, I fought against Chuck Norris several times and lost all the battles. In fact, that was part of the catalyst that made us realise that slayers were only humans and that men can be equally as capable slayers as women. You will hopefully get a chance to meet and even fight against Mr. Norris sometime throughout the school year.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> I see. So, Ms. Summers, what are you doing here in the library?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> I&#8217;m looking for a book I misplaced.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> About slaying?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> No, about cooking. A cookbook from the late 60s with a nice spinach, Broccoli and cheese casserole.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Types a few things on the keyboard.]</span> Ms. Summers, I was able to find a recipe for a casserole like that from that era.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Buffy:</strong> Let me see. <span class="inlinedesc">[Looks]</span> Wow! Looks great. Becky, you've got a lot of potential as a slayer.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Why, thank you!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Bleh! <span class="inlinedesc">[He puts his head in his hands.]</span></p></div></section></section></main>
