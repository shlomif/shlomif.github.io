Richard Hoffer. We traced him, and DNA tests confirm that he is your father.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Richard:</strong> Faith!&#8230; I worked as an Electrical and Mechanical technician in the Navy - doing maintenance and fixing equipment that broke. I was good at it and took my job seriously, but was never much of a combat fighter.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Richard:</strong> Anyway, during shore leaves I had the unfortunate habit of drinking and ending up waking the next morning with a hangover and a woman by my side, whom I always ended up buying breakfast and leaving my contact details. They were all happy to correspond with me, except one - your mother.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Oh&#8230; <span class="inlinedesc">[She starts crying.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Richard:</strong> Anyway, I ended up trying to trace the whereabouts of your mother, and was told she and her daughter were killed by criminals.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> My reported death was a cover story&#8230; <span class="inlinedesc">[She Continues to cry.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Richard:</strong> Yes. Something died in me inside that moment, and I stopped drinking after that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> I don&#8217;t drink either&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Richard:</strong> Anyway, I heard you saved the world several times. I was told you are a slayer, who helps fight demons. I didn&#8217;t witness that first hand, but I heard enough stories so I believe that is the case.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Richard:</strong> But I guess it&#8217;s true that the apple sometimes completely supplants the tree.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> I&#8217;m sure you are a great warrior too. <span class="inlinedesc">[She moves towards Richard and they hug each other.]</span></p></div><div class="description"><p>[ They remain hugging for a while. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> Dad, your belly is so soft.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Richard:</strong> OK, now that that&#8217;s behind us, I should admit that I ended up marrying a very nice lady (her name is Gabrielle) and we have two children &#8212; a boy and a girl. They are here and want to meet you.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Faith:</strong> I&#8217;d love that. I think mine are sound asleep now being relieved, but Xander, that&#8217;s how we refer to my husband, Alexander Harris, will be happy to tag along and meet your family. I think we can grab some burgers and icecream.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Richard:</strong> Sure, that&#8217;ll be great. Open commerce day&#8230;</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut. ]</p></div></section></main>
