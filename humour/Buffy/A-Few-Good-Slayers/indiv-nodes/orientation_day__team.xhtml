Rebecca &#8220;Becky&#8221; Shepherd is shown walking in the high school lobby listening to the song playing from her smartphone that is tucked on her belt. She is wearing a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony%3A_Friendship_Is_Magic">My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic</a> shirt, and has a name tag that reads "Rebecca Shepherd (Slayer)". ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Yo, Brony girl, stop!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Hey, sorry for not paying attention <span class="inlinedesc">[she pauses the music]</span>. What&#8217;s up?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Chankey here <span class="inlinedesc">[points at Chankey]</span> and I are looking for a slayer to complete our team. You don&#8217;t seem exactly like slayer-material, but since all the other slayers we talked with were taken, I guess we should settle on you.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Becky smiles. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Sure, I&#8217;d love to be team with you. Let&#8217;s register.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ She uses her smartphone to register. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> OK, done.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[in an English accent]</span> Smashing!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Chankey, is it? Are you British?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Yes, Ms. Shepherd.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> &#8220;Becky&#8221; please.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Yes, well, I am of Indian descent and carry an Indian name. I have photographic memory, and did extremely well in my studies. I was supposed to start studying in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harrow_School">Harrow School</a> (the notorious public school, or what you Americans will call a &#8220;private school&#8221;) because I had many friends there, but then became aware of some demonic activity in Greater London, and was indoctrinated as a watcher-wannabe here.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> I don&#8217;t have any friends here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Grabbing his hand.]</span> I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll make some.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Yes. Most of my friends who have been kept out of the demonic underworld loop thought I was crazy for going to "Sunnydale High School" rather than to Harrow, which is the second most prestigious school in Britain.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Heh, well, my friends accept the fact that I'm <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/indiv-nodes/selina-and-the-three.xhtml">getting weirder, but more amusing in the process</a>. I wish I could completely stop speaking in riddles, but I cannot copy my mind into the outside world, and there are stupid trolls on online forums and subforums.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Heh, my thoughts exactly.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Anyway, Becky, what about you? What&#8217;s your story?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Well, I grew up and lived in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte%2C_North_Carolina">Charlotte, North Carolina</a> (great town!). My mother&#8217;s Jewish and I&#8217;m kind of a spoiled <a href="http://duckduckgo.com/?q=jewish%20american%20princess">Jewish American Princess</a>.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Heh, like <a href="http://spaceballs.wikia.com/wiki/Princess_Vespa">Princess Vespa</a> in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a>?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Oh, I love this film, and I love the way she undergoes a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharsis">Catharsis</a>.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Anyway, school was pretty easy for me, and I already finished high school Math and expected to start studying Mathematics in a local university next year, when a friend of mine and I ran into a vampire while walking in downtown Charlotte. He was downright scary, but I tried to be as calm as possible and ran with my friend into a large diner, where I explained everything. Luckily for us there were a male slayer and his female watcher there - a couple.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> They took care of the vampire, and after that when we got talking, they told me that they thought I had a great potential to become a slayer, and I ended up here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Chankey:</strong> Smashing!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> OK, OK, God works in mysterious ways - making a brony girl / Miley Cyrus aficionado into a slayer <span class="inlinedesc">[cut to Becky, she is smiling and saying &#8220;heh&#8221;]</span> and making me, who has practised Martial Arts for years, and is incredibly athletic (&#8220;Buff-y-ed&#8221;, heh!) into a freaking warlock.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Cliff:</strong> Anyway, my name is Cliff Farrel, I&#8217;m from coastal Florida, and I got introduced to casting spells by a few local sorcerers and witches. I was good at it, and they told me I should enrol here and I did. So now I&#8217;m getting to be bossed around by Miss &#8220;I&#8217;m a J.A.P. and I&#8217;m proud of it&#8221; Brony Girl here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Becky:</strong> Listen, for your information, I did some martial arts over in Israel, when I visited it this summer, and I was told I was pretty good at it, but more importantly - there&#8217;s more to being a good slayer than senselessly kicking vampires&#8217; ass.</p></div></section></main>
