Every half decent manual out there shows you "grep hello *" as one of the first example.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Michelle:</strong> Yeah. OK, back to business. Now, you know how commands are parsed in bash?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Alan:</strong> More or less. I know that asterisk expands to the list of files, and that double quotes wrap stuff where I can still put variables, and single quotes are the same only with dollars and backslashes being that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Michelle:</strong> Good boy. <span class="inlinedesc">[ Pats his head ]</span> Now, there are some more caveats, especially with bash. Back-quotes are your worst nightmare - they execute the command and return its output on the command line. Very dangerous. But they are treated like a string. $( ... ) is a much nicer version that puts them in a sub-shell. Won't work in System V's /bin/sh, but we don't care about them.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Alan:</strong> Why?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Michelle:</strong> I would not touch such a system voluntarily with a ten-meters pole.
