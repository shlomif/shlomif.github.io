Well, I&#8217;ve decided to not give in, and praise a few living great men, who are likely <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">messiahs</a> or "hacker monarchs".</p><p>I hereby praise <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Benedict_XVI">the former Pope Benedict XVI</a>, who resigned back in 2013 (see <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#departing_pope_about_twitter">this mini-essay I wrote shortly after that</a> for the reasons), the Japanese <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akihito">Emperor Emeritus Akihito</a>, the head of the Linux kernel project <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, the former president of the Free Software Foundation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard M. Stallman (RMS)</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a>, who is a software developer who created the Python programming language.</p><p>They all became hacker kings due to either birth, or by choice, and they all <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse#Slaying_in_the_Selinaverse">"slew"</a> themselves (metaphorically) and retired (similar to <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/linus-torvalds-bus-factor/">Solon's tactic</a>); at least temporarily.</p><p>I also dedicate it to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">Queen Elizabeth II</a>, who is a good woman, a great woman, and likely may admit to being a hacker monarch by now. While "the media" may paint her as senile, I suspect she is not. However, she may opt to follow suit and become queen regnant Emerita (and still remain a wonderful and effective hacker monarch/messiah), due to old age.</p><p>Note that I do not intend to demote the alternatives to the projects they headed, or claim that I fully approve of all their actions and opinions. I am a secular Jewish resident and citizen of Israel, and while I like and use Python, I use many other programming languages (whether Turing-complete or not). I also do not always agree with Stallman's opinions and I <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/what-i-learned-from-porting-to-freebsd">recently tried porting some of my FOSS projects</a> to FreeBSD. But we can all learn from each other.</p><p>Also note that I do not wish them (or anyone else) to physically die, soon or ever. I just want people to acknowledge their worth, and appreciate them, including when they are still alive. ]</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ That put aside, the names of the two terminators, which were chosen as Hebrew names which were cognate with "Arnold" and "Emma", coincide with those of my late grandfather-on-my-father's side, Aharon Fish, whom I knew and loved up to my twenties, and his younger sister, Channah Fish, who lived up to 103 and passed away a few years ago (as of 2021). They were both Warsaw-born Jews and the only known surviving siblings from their family after WWII.</p><p>I dedicate this screenplay to their memory as well. ]</p></div></section></main>
