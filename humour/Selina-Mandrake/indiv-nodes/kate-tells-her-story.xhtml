Well, I was actually born Kate Hampshire, a young Anglican baby born to English parents on French soil. I grew up among French children, who welcomed me as their own, but when my parents and I returned back to England when I was 5 years old, I was ridiculed for my French, and so wanted to hear nothing of it, until I was older and had to relearn French much more painfully.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> But you still had a trace of a French accent&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Precisely.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Anyway, as opposed to Dumas&#8217; description, I was a brunette, for which some no-goodnicks from my whereabouts, ridiculed me for being of Jewish descent, but eventually, I knew not to care. There were plenty of other brunette girls among my friends, anyway.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Anyway, my father wanted me to learn the proper Christian law and ethics, so he taught me how to read English, and told me to read the Bible. I grew to love it, and considered the various characters there as my friends.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Moreover, I organised various shows of the Bible, by children at the local parish, often with a lot of humour thrown in, in order to captivate the crowd. Our minister believed that this was blasphemous, so he summoned the local Bishop to see, who not only enjoyed our shows, but also told the reverend that we were making the Bible something living and dynamic, and so it should be encouraged.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> As a result, I quickly became notorious for my shows, which also captured the attention of the local nobility, the Lords of Canterson. The older brother, who liked me so much, became infatuated with me, courted me, and eventually we got married.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> We led a happy marriage, but it was terminated shortly after that, when the lord, my husband, became sick, and then died. It was not my fault, but I was devastated from it, and after recovering, told the lord&#8217;s younger brother, the now honourable Lord James Canterson, that I was going to relocate to Paris, France, for a change of scenery. He agreed.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> As a result, I, as Lady Canterson, arrived at Paris to try my luck in finding a new life. I was able to make a small profit teaching English and the English bible to many students who were eager to learn, but my social life took a turn, to the worse, at first. You see, I kept telling the various people at parties and other social events of my previous life as an entertainer and also reciting some of my takes on Biblical things with improvisations. Many men and women found it amusing and liked me, but a minority of the women started spreading rumours that I killed my husband, and was actually glad he died, and were trying to put me down.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-dartagnan-advice-to-kate"><header><h5 id="dartagnan-advice-to-kate">d&#8217;Artagnan&#8217;s Advice</h5></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> At one point, I could not take it anymore, and I went to a corner couch, sat down, and started crying. I was joined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Artagnan">d&#8217;Artagnan</a>, a young (about my age), and promising, guard at the des Essarts&#8217; company of guards, who was a big fan of me and my stories about what happened in the Bible, and he asked me:</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Showing the couch ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">D&#8217;Artagnan:</strong> Milady, que se passe-t-il? <span class="inlinedesc">[ = &#8220;Milady, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; ]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Milady Kate:</strong> Rien <span class="inlinedesc">[ = &#8220;nothing&#8221;.

Comme je ne porte plus le deuil et que je semble heureuse, les autres femmes croient que j&#8217;ai tu&#233; mon mari. <span class="inlinedesc">[ = &#8220;OK. The other women think I killed my husband because I&#8217;m now no longer grieving and because I seem happy.&#8221;]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">D&#8217;Artagnan:</strong> Sottises!

We ended up falling in love and having an affair, and while we did not go public about it, we did not really hide it, and pretty soon everyone knew, and many single people and couples were jealous of us. But we didn&#8217;t care.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> I should also tell you about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Austria">the Queen, Anne of Austria</a>. She was a beautiful woman, but needy and jealous and wanted the King, Louis XIII, to love her, without her doing anything to deserve it. The King and his prime minister, Cardinal Richelieu, despised her for her incompetence, which made her feel even more deprived of love that she supposedly deserved. I sometimes had to provide support for some of her maids, who were offended by her abuse, and ended up giving them d&#8217;Artagnan&#8217;s advice, which I noticed had made them quickly lose their job, and then meeting me and telling me how relieved they were.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> In any case, I was expecting d&#8217;Artagnan to propose soon after all that, when it was announced that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_La_Rochelle">conquest of La Rochelle</a> was about to take place, and that d&#8217;Artagnan will relocate there. I was somewhat worried for his future, and thought we would have to part soon.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-kate-s-assignment"><header><h5 id="kate-s-assignment">Kate&#8217;s Assignment</h5></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> However, nothing prepared me for the time when my maid woke me up in the middle of the night and informed me that two of the King&#8217;s Musketeers were at the door. I wondered why. The Musketeers told me the king asked to see me, so I wore a plain dress, and they took me in a carriage to the palace. They escorted me to a room where I saw the king sitting at an armchair, as well as d&#8217;Artagnan, and his good friend and mentor, <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Athos_(Selinaverse)">Athos</a>, standing at a corner.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Showing the scene at the Palace. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Louis XIII:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[In English with a French accent]</span> Hello, Lady Canterson.

In fact, we brought you here, in order to slay <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham">Lord Buckingham</a>, so he won&#8217;t interfere with our planned attack of La Rochelle.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Milady Kate:</strong> Kill Lord Buckingham?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Cardinal Richelieu:</strong> I said &#8220;slay&#8221; - not &#8220;kill&#8221;. There is a difference as you shall see.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Cardinal Richelieu:</strong> We have failed at convincing Lord Buckingham that he should refrain from attacking us, which will cause many innocent lives to be lost and so we have to resort to take him out of the equation.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Louis XIII:</strong> Here&#8217;s the deal: you will carry these three letters signed by his eminence, by the King of England and by me, that will instruct whoever reads them to do everything within reason to assist you in your mission. M. Athos and M. d&#8217;Artagnan will escort you, and they will protect you with their lives if necessary.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Louis XIII:</strong> The plan is: go to your house and take the belongings you care about; take a fast carriage to Calais and cross the channel; once in England, find some people you know to help you find a body similar to Lord Buckingham, find someone who will take the blame for it (your king will make sure nothing bad happens to him), slay Lord Buckingham, and take a carriage with him to Plymouth where you will board a ship to the British colonies of America, and both start a new life. Is that clear?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Milady Kate:</strong> Yes, your majesty. <span class="inlinedesc">[She bows.]</span></p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Milady Kate, Athos and d&#8217;Artagnan leave. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> So we did it all, despite some minor setbacks, in part due to me bitching about the whole situation.

I kept in touch with Mr. George Smith, as he was now called for a while until he no longer needed me. I was also eventually been indoctrinated as a vampire, for whom the fact that she once slew the 1st Duke of Buckingham was merely an anecdote.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> But all this changed shortly after the publication of <i class="italics">The Three Musketeers</i> in the 1840s. Having dismissed Alexandre Dumas as a second-rate writer of popular books, I was surprised that many people approached me in my new life as Mrs. Kate Black requesting that I will slay them. Eventually, I found out about the novel, sent a letter to M. Dumas that I was coming to visit him, and travelled by ship to France to meet him at his home in Paris. This is what happened.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut to Alexandre Dumas&#8217; Home ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dumas:</strong> Good morning, Madame Black, I have heard so much about you, but have no idea why you would like to meet me, all of a sudden.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> M.
