I kept in touch with Mr. George Smith, as he was now called for a while until he no longer needed me. I was also eventually been indoctrinated as a vampire, for whom the fact that she once slew the 1st Duke of Buckingham was merely an anecdote.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> But all this changed shortly after the publication of <i class="italics">The Three Musketeers</i> in the 1840s. Having dismissed Alexandre Dumas as a second-rate writer of popular books, I was surprised that many people approached me in my new life as Mrs. Kate Black requesting that I will slay them. Eventually, I found out about the novel, sent a letter to M. Dumas that I was coming to visit him, and travelled by ship to France to meet him at his home in Paris. This is what happened.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut to Alexandre Dumas&#8217; Home ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dumas:</strong> Good morning, Madame Black, I have heard so much about you, but have no idea why you would like to meet me, all of a sudden.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> M.
