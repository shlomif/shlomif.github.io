And that means - cuneiform!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Aharon:</strong> Ah, cuneiform. That brings back memories.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Yes, lots of memories.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Heh, pleasant memories?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Well: nostalgic ones, but not really pleasant ones. You see, the western Semitic people, primarily those who spoke the various Hebrew languages and Aramaic, had mostly converted to use the Alphabet, which appeared like a sloppy, hard to read, and a poor man&#8217;s writing system. They often used it to write about anything including drinking, being happy and jolly, spreading vicious rumours, erotica, and even incest.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Some peoples used it as one of their technological and strategical advantages, and made sure to pass many important messages.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> On the other hand, Cuneiform had originally been created for Sumerian, which many considered as a holy and mystical language that must be kept alive, and was adopted for Akkadian and its essentially similar variations of Babylonian and Assyrian, which reflected an old and no longer usable Semitic dialect, that most people on the street did not know or liked.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Aharon:</strong> Yes, this whole issue ended when everyone started to learn and use Aramaic, which was spoken and written by many people, stretched into all directions, incorporated many foreign words, and developed dialects, sub-dialects and personal idioms. Incredibly similarly to what is happening with English today.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Yes, the age when Aramaic became the Lingua franca was wonderful. So although Aharon and I had to learn Cuneiform, we now realise how much we detested it.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> OK, but it is still of utility for me as an Archaeologist.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> And we can help.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> You too? <span class="inlinedesc">[Selina looks at her.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Of course! See, my obsession with the Bible continued throughout my life, and later on I became a scholar: first as a married woman who just frequented universities and learned things from the male professors and students; later on, as someone who helped some professors with their research, and eventually got credited; and as time progressed, I got a B.A., and then a Ph.D., and am now a professor.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Wow, that&#8217;s great.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> And I studied Cuneiform and the memory is still fresh.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Smashing! OK, so I gather you can help me get ready for the test?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Aharon:</strong> We will be delighted. Vampires still have responsibilities as normal human beings, and we always try to assist a fellow vampire.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Great! OK, let&#8217;s start. OK, show me some glyphs and ask me about how to pronounce them, and what they mean and where.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> OK, let&#8217;s start&#8230; <span class="inlinedesc">[she takes Selina&#8217;s book and covers the page]</span> What is this glyph?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Bugger me if I know, heh.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Kate, Mosheh and Aharon laugh. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> OK, let me guess&#8230;</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Camera moves up, end credits. ]</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ END. ]</p></div></section></main>
