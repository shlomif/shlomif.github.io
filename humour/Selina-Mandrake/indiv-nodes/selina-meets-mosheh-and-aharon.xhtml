How lame!</p><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> But what were these slaying tests, and The Guide, and these weird demons, and&#8230; God, they made me feel so helpless, and mad, and sad, and&#8230; all for becoming a silly <a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Bajoran">Bajoran</a> god?</p><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[she stands up]</span> Couldn&#8217;t you have given me a written examination?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> That would not be adequate for us. See, as vampires, we constantly have to deal with a lot of emotions and frustrations in our personal and professional lives. Dispelling is not always easy, and you are going to encounter many obstacles along the way from envious people, who are threatened by what you say, or stubborn people, or sycophants, or even people who care about what you say or have important amendments.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Dispelling is not just fun and games, you know.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> I see. <span class="inlinedesc">[Selina giggles.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> I should also tell you about the <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Q_Continuum_(Selinaverse)">Q continuum</a>.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Yes, I gather it existed, only it seems that the Qs cannot be omnipotent, because it&#8217;s a logical and mathematical impossibility.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> They are not. They are regular humanoids, or other aliens, who have ascended to be vampires and Qs, and who possess extremely powerful (but not omnipotent or &#8220;supernatural&#8221;) technology.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> I see. Did they provide the special effects?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> You guessed it.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> OK, I&#8217;m still mad at you. But since I still find all this fascinating (I have to, as a wannabe Archaeologist and stuff), I&#8217;m going to continue talking to you, despite being mad.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Sure. You may wish to know that the Bajoran scholars considered dispelling as the next logical level after slaying.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> And The Slayer was Buffy from the show?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> No. The fictional Buffy Anne Summers was a mighty slayer, but she was just The Vampire Slayer. The Slayer and the concept of slaying predates her.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> I see. So whom do I have the dubious honour to succeed?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> This is a complicated story, but let me ask you: have you read the novel <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers"><i class="italics">The Three Muskeeters</i></a>?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> By <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas">Dumas</a>?

Well, I was actually born Kate Hampshire, a young Anglican baby born to English parents on French soil. I grew up among French children, who welcomed me as their own, but when my parents and I returned back to England when I was 5 years old, I was ridiculed for my French, and so wanted to hear nothing of it, until I was older and had to relearn French much more painfully.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> But you still had a trace of a French accent&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Precisely.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Anyway, as opposed to Dumas&#8217; description, I was a brunette, for which some no-goodnicks from my whereabouts, ridiculed me for being of Jewish descent, but eventually, I knew not to care. There were plenty of other brunette girls among my friends, anyway.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Anyway, my father wanted me to learn the proper Christian law and ethics, so he taught me how to read English, and told me to read the Bible. I grew to love it, and considered the various characters there as my friends.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Moreover, I organised various shows of the Bible, by children at the local parish, often with a lot of humour thrown in, in order to captivate the crowd. Our minister believed that this was blasphemous, so he summoned the local Bishop to see, who not only enjoyed our shows, but also told the reverend that we were making the Bible something living and dynamic, and so it should be encouraged.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> As a result, I quickly became notorious for my shows, which also captured the attention of the local nobility, the Lords of Canterson. The older brother, who liked me so much, became infatuated with me, courted me, and eventually we got married.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> We led a happy marriage, but it was terminated shortly after that, when the lord, my husband, became sick, and then died. It was not my fault, but I was devastated from it, and after recovering, told the lord&#8217;s younger brother, the now honourable Lord James Canterson, that I was going to relocate to Paris, France, for a change of scenery. He agreed.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> As a result, I, as Lady Canterson, arrived at Paris to try my luck in finding a new life. I was able to make a small profit teaching English and the English bible to many students who were eager to learn, but my social life took a turn, to the worse, at first. You see, I kept telling the various people at parties and other social events of my previous life as an entertainer and also reciting some of my takes on Biblical things with improvisations. Many men and women found it amusing and liked me, but a minority of the women started spreading rumours that I killed my husband, and was actually glad he died, and were trying to put me down.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-dartagnan-advice-to-kate"><header><h5 id="dartagnan-advice-to-kate">d&#8217;Artagnan&#8217;s Advice</h5></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> At one point, I could not take it anymore, and I went to a corner couch, sat down, and started crying. I was joined by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%27Artagnan">d&#8217;Artagnan</a>, a young (about my age), and promising, guard at the des Essarts&#8217; company of guards, who was a big fan of me and my stories about what happened in the Bible, and he asked me:</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Showing the couch ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">D&#8217;Artagnan:</strong> Milady, que se passe-t-il? <span class="inlinedesc">[ = &#8220;Milady, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; ]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Milady Kate:</strong> Rien <span class="inlinedesc">[ = &#8220;nothing&#8221;.

We ended up falling in love and having an affair, and while we did not go public about it, we did not really hide it, and pretty soon everyone knew, and many single people and couples were jealous of us. But we didn&#8217;t care.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> I should also tell you about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Austria">the Queen, Anne of Austria</a>. She was a beautiful woman, but needy and jealous and wanted the King, Louis XIII, to love her, without her doing anything to deserve it. The King and his prime minister, Cardinal Richelieu, despised her for her incompetence, which made her feel even more deprived of love that she supposedly deserved. I sometimes had to provide support for some of her maids, who were offended by her abuse, and ended up giving them d&#8217;Artagnan&#8217;s advice, which I noticed had made them quickly lose their job, and then meeting me and telling me how relieved they were.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> In any case, I was expecting d&#8217;Artagnan to propose soon after all that, when it was announced that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_La_Rochelle">conquest of La Rochelle</a> was about to take place, and that d&#8217;Artagnan will relocate there.

They escorted me to a room where I saw the king sitting at an armchair, as well as d&#8217;Artagnan, and his good friend and mentor, <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Athos_(Selinaverse)">Athos</a>, standing at a corner.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Showing the scene at the Palace. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Louis XIII:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[In English with a French accent]</span> Hello, Lady Canterson.

I kept in touch with Mr. George Smith, as he was now called for a while until he no longer needed me. I was also eventually been indoctrinated as a vampire, for whom the fact that she once slew the 1st Duke of Buckingham was merely an anecdote.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> But all this changed shortly after the publication of <i class="italics">The Three Musketeers</i> in the 1840s. Having dismissed Alexandre Dumas as a second-rate writer of popular books, I was surprised that many people approached me in my new life as Mrs. Kate Black requesting that I will slay them. Eventually, I found out about the novel, sent a letter to M. Dumas that I was coming to visit him, and travelled by ship to France to meet him at his home in Paris.

See, one of the prophecies given by the Bajoran Prophets was that one day the Bajorans themselves will no longer need them. Kai Winn predicted that the Dispeller will finally put the whole ordeal to rest. So the Bajorans have placed the orbs on public display for everyone to experience and talk to the Prophets, but will no longer take such prophecies seriously.

As hard-to-fathom Q is, he is still just humanoid, who while jump-starting the alien civilisation that became the Q Continuum, and has been considered The Invisible, admits that after 6 milliard years, it is a good idea to stop appearing blas&#233;, and show some emotion and compassion for his friends, including his former wives and his children.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> So Q has children?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Moreover, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahless">Kahless</a> was revealed to having been alive in the quadrant all the time under his true (but constantly disputed) identity. He was not as capable a physical warrior as was once reported (and certainly isn&#8217;t now) &#8212; just someone who knew how to avoid fighting, and reach a middle ground without anyone getting hurt, and nor is he as impressive physically as reported back then. He returned in "The Day of The Living Dead" to guide the Klingons back into rationality and carefulness instead of what became their traditional stubbornness and haste.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Furthermore, here on Earth, we start to realise that instead of the &#8220;Eye for an eye&#8221; and &#8220;May my soul die with Philistines&#8221; adages, which cause everyone to suffer and be resentful, it is time to adopt a more rational and compassionate idiom, as exemplified by the noble practice of <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</a>, which yields far better long-term results.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Finally, we admit to ourselves that sometimes <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">amateurs</a> (being people who like what they do, people who don&#8217;t play by the rules, and finally people who are not professional) can compete with the large budgets and high discipline of professionals, and even exceed it, because they can deliver more and at greater capacity, tend to think outside the box, and simply tend to avoid the many invisible rules that plague more professional structures.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> The so-called New Age is finally arriving, and we are about to establish the worldwide Neo-Semitic culture, based on diversity, cross-pollination, acceptance, tolerance, rationality, and life.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut to Selina. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Wipes some tears from her face]</span> Beautiful - I am glad I proved of service.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-getting-help-with-cuneiform"><header><h4 id="getting-help-with-cuneiform">Selina Gets Help with her Cuneiform Homework</h4></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Anyway, even if I am a vampirella, or a heroine, or a Q, or whatever, I still have my responsibilities as a student of Near East archaeology.

You see, the western Semitic people, primarily those who spoke the various Hebrew languages and Aramaic, had mostly converted to use the Alphabet, which appeared like a sloppy, hard to read, and a poor man&#8217;s writing system. They often used it to write about anything including drinking, being happy and jolly, spreading vicious rumours, erotica, and even incest.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Some peoples used it as one of their technological and strategical advantages, and made sure to pass many important messages.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> On the other hand, Cuneiform had originally been created for Sumerian, which many considered as a holy and mystical language that must be kept alive, and was adopted for Akkadian and its essentially similar variations of Babylonian and Assyrian, which reflected an old and no longer usable Semitic dialect, that most people on the street did not know or liked.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Aharon:</strong> Yes, this whole issue ended when everyone started to learn and use Aramaic, which was spoken and written by many people, stretched into all directions, incorporated many foreign words, and developed dialects, sub-dialects and personal idioms. Incredibly similarly to what is happening with English today.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Yes, the age when Aramaic became the Lingua franca was wonderful. So although Aharon and I had to learn Cuneiform, we now realise how much we detested it.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> OK, but it is still of utility for me as an Archaeologist.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> And we can help.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> You too? <span class="inlinedesc">[Selina looks at her.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Of course!
