I&#8217;ll be The Dispeller. <span class="inlinedesc">[she stands up]</span> I&#8217;ll dispel lots of bad idioms, and falsehoods <span class="inlinedesc">[gesture with her hand ]</span> being Selina Mandrake - <b class="bold">The Dispeller</b>&#8230;</p><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> Oh, who am I kidding? That is so not me. I don&#8217;t want to be worshipped as a profile or a goddess or whatever. Can&#8217;t I just be Selina&#8230; Mandrake? The wonderful me? The individual? Can&#8217;t I dispel the whole thing?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Aharon:</strong> I knew you can do it, Selina.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[tears of joy on his eyes]</span> yes, indeed. See, one of the prophecies given by the Bajoran Prophets was that one day the Bajorans themselves will no longer need them. Kai Winn predicted that the Dispeller will finally put the whole ordeal to rest. So the Bajorans have placed the orbs on public display for everyone to experience and talk to the Prophets, but will no longer take such prophecies seriously. The Prophets of the wormhole will continue to be an active field of research for the Bajorans and the Q Continuum, but won&#8217;t be considered an object of worship.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Tomorrow&#8217;s day in Bajor will not be "The Day of the Dispeller", but rather "The Day of Selina Mandrake", the wonderful, beautiful, intelligent, and, as some Americans will say, &#8220;awesome&#8221;, young woman, but an individual, and not a mere label.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> In the meanwhile, people all across the universe, are rethinking their long-term personality and behaviour. As hard-to-fathom Q is, he is still just humanoid, who while jump-starting the alien civilisation that became the Q Continuum, and has been considered The Invisible, admits that after 6 milliard years, it is a good idea to stop appearing blas&#233;, and show some emotion and compassion for his friends, including his former wives and his children.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> So Q has children?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Indeed.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Moreover, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kahless">Kahless</a> was revealed to having been alive in the quadrant all the time under his true (but constantly disputed) identity. He was not as capable a physical warrior as was once reported (and certainly isn&#8217;t now) &#8212; just someone who knew how to avoid fighting, and reach a middle ground without anyone getting hurt, and nor is he as impressive physically as reported back then. He returned in "The Day of The Living Dead" to guide the Klingons back into rationality and carefulness instead of what became their traditional stubbornness and haste.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Furthermore, here on Earth, we start to realise that instead of the &#8220;Eye for an eye&#8221; and &#8220;May my soul die with Philistines&#8221; adages, which cause everyone to suffer and be resentful, it is time to adopt a more rational and compassionate idiom, as exemplified by the noble practice of <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</a>, which yields far better long-term results.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Finally, we admit to ourselves that sometimes <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">amateurs</a> (being people who like what they do, people who don&#8217;t play by the rules, and finally people who are not professional) can compete with the large budgets and high discipline of professionals, and even exceed it, because they can deliver more and at greater capacity, tend to think outside the box, and simply tend to avoid the many invisible rules that plague more professional structures.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> The so-called New Age is finally arriving, and we are about to establish the worldwide Neo-Semitic culture, based on diversity, cross-pollination, acceptance, tolerance, rationality, and life.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut to Selina. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Wipes some tears from her face]</span> Beautiful - I am glad I proved of service.</p></div></section></main>
