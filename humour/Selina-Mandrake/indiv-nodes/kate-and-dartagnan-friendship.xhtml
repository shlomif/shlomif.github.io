We ended up falling in love and having an affair, and while we did not go public about it, we did not really hide it, and pretty soon everyone knew, and many single people and couples were jealous of us. But we didn&#8217;t care.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> I should also tell you about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Austria">the Queen, Anne of Austria</a>. She was a beautiful woman, but needy and jealous and wanted the King, Louis XIII, to love her, without her doing anything to deserve it. The King and his prime minister, Cardinal Richelieu, despised her for her incompetence, which made her feel even more deprived of love that she supposedly deserved. I sometimes had to provide support for some of her maids, who were offended by her abuse, and ended up giving them d&#8217;Artagnan&#8217;s advice, which I noticed had made them quickly lose their job, and then meeting me and telling me how relieved they were.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> In any case, I was expecting d&#8217;Artagnan to propose soon after all that, when it was announced that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_La_Rochelle">conquest of La Rochelle</a> was about to take place, and that d&#8217;Artagnan will relocate there. I was somewhat worried for his future, and thought we would have to part soon.</p></div></section></main>
