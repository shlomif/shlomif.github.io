Well, I was actually born Kate Hampshire, a young Anglican baby born to English parents on French soil. I grew up among French children, who welcomed me as their own, but when my parents and I returned back to England when I was 5 years old, I was ridiculed for my French, and so wanted to hear nothing of it, until I was older and had to relearn French much more painfully.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> But you still had a trace of a French accent&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Precisely.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Anyway, as opposed to Dumas&#8217; description, I was a brunette, for which some no-goodnicks from my whereabouts, ridiculed me for being of Jewish descent, but eventually, I knew not to care. There were plenty of other brunette girls among my friends, anyway.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Anyway, my father wanted me to learn the proper Christian law and ethics, so he taught me how to read English, and told me to read the Bible. I grew to love it, and considered the various characters there as my friends.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Moreover, I organised various shows of the Bible, by children at the local parish, often with a lot of humour thrown in, in order to captivate the crowd. Our minister believed that this was blasphemous, so he summoned the local Bishop to see, who not only enjoyed our shows, but also told the reverend that we were making the Bible something living and dynamic, and so it should be encouraged.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> As a result, I quickly became notorious for my shows, which also captured the attention of the local nobility, the Lords of Canterson. The older brother, who liked me so much, became infatuated with me, courted me, and eventually we got married.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> We led a happy marriage, but it was terminated shortly after that, when the lord, my husband, became sick, and then died. It was not my fault, but I was devastated from it, and after recovering, told the lord&#8217;s younger brother, the now honourable Lord James Canterson, that I was going to relocate to Paris, France, for a change of scenery. He agreed.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> As a result, I, as Lady Canterson, arrived at Paris to try my luck in finding a new life. I was able to make a small profit teaching English and the English bible to many students who were eager to learn, but my social life took a turn, to the worse, at first. You see, I kept telling the various people at parties and other social events of my previous life as an entertainer and also reciting some of my takes on Biblical things with improvisations. Many men and women found it amusing and liked me, but a minority of the women started spreading rumours that I killed my husband, and was actually glad he died, and were trying to put me down.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-dartagnan-advice-to-kate"><header><h5 id="dartagnan-advice-to-kate">d&#8217;Artagnan&#8217;s Advice</h5></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate&#8217;s voice:</strong> At one point, I could not take it anymore, and I went to a corner couch, sat down, and started crying.

You see, the western Semitic people, primarily those who spoke the various Hebrew languages and Aramaic, had mostly converted to use the Alphabet, which appeared like a sloppy, hard to read, and a poor man&#8217;s writing system. They often used it to write about anything including drinking, being happy and jolly, spreading vicious rumours, erotica, and even incest.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Some peoples used it as one of their technological and strategical advantages, and made sure to pass many important messages.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> On the other hand, Cuneiform had originally been created for Sumerian, which many considered as a holy and mystical language that must be kept alive, and was adopted for Akkadian and its essentially similar variations of Babylonian and Assyrian, which reflected an old and no longer usable Semitic dialect, that most people on the street did not know or liked.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Aharon:</strong> Yes, this whole issue ended when everyone started to learn and use Aramaic, which was spoken and written by many people, stretched into all directions, incorporated many foreign words, and developed dialects, sub-dialects and personal idioms. Incredibly similarly to what is happening with English today.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Yes, the age when Aramaic became the Lingua franca was wonderful. So although Aharon and I had to learn Cuneiform, we now realise how much we detested it.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> OK, but it is still of utility for me as an Archaeologist.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> And we can help.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Selina:</strong> You too? <span class="inlinedesc">[Selina looks at her.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kate:</strong> Of course!
