                      Chuck Norris wrote a complete Perl 6 implementation in a day,
                      but then destroyed all evidence with his bare hands, so
                      no-one will know his secrets.

                      Chuck Norris is his own boss. If you hire him, he'll
                      tell your boss what to do.

                      Chuck Norris is the ghost author of the entire Debian

                      computer. As a result, when he uses Microsoft Windows,

                      Chuck Norris is a real programmer. He writes programs by

                      Chuck Norris can make the statement "This statement is
                      false." a true one.

                      Chuck Norris can end world hunger, but he thinks that
                      hungry people make humanity a more challenging adversary.
                      If everyone had enough to eat, it would be too easy for
                      him.

                      Chuck Norris once wrote a 10 million lines C++ program in
                      Microsoft Notepad without having to use the backspace
                      key. And it compiled without errors or warnings, and was
                      100% bug-free.

                      If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad
                      will go to the mountain. If the mountain will not come to
                      Chuck Norris, then the mountain will suffer Norris&#8217;s
                      wrath for not complying with his whims.

                      Chuck Norris was never a newbie! He will kill anyone who
                      implies otherwise. In a very not newbie-like manner.

                      If Chuck Norris had been born before World War II, there
                      would have been only one world war. However, there would

                      Nazis and Communists.

                      An apple a day will keep Chuck Norris away. But not for

                      Reality to be conquered must be obeyed. You&#8217;d better obey
                      Chuck Norris or he&#8217;ll conquer you.

                      Chuck Norris had a problem so he decided to use regular
                      expressions. Now, all the World&#8217;s problems are solved.

                      God created the world in 6 days and rested on the 7th.
                      Chuck Norris created the world in one day, and has been
                      incrementally destroying it every day since, without

                      Chuck Norris is always right. Even if he says that &#8220;A
                      is not-A&#8221;, he would be right, because Logic is
                      subject to his whims.

                      Computers are useless because they can only give you
                      answers. Chuck Norris is not useless, because he knows the
                      questions which these answers belong to.

                      And it would have taken him even less time to destroy
                      it.

                      Chuck Norris once counted all the real numbers on his

                      Only two things are infinite: the universe, and Chuck
                      Norris&#8217;s destruction ability. And we cannot be sure about
                      the former thanks to the latter.

                      When Chuck Norris uses git, he takes a coffee break after
                      initiating every git commit. And then he waits for the
                      commit to finish.

                      Chuck Norris is the reason why OpenBSD is called OpenBSD.
                      They wanted to call it LockedDownBSD but couldn't find a
                      way to keep Chuck Norris out!

Chuck Norris does not keep any numbers on his mobile phone&#8217;s address book.
Instead, he memorised the entire phone directory.

                      When Chuck Norris drops a cat, it falls on its back so it
                      won&#8217;t lose eye contact with Chuck.

                      Corollary:
                      If Chuck Norris had dropped his toasts, they would have
                      fallen on the dry side, so they would have stayed on his
                      good side. But Chuck Norris <b>never</b> drops toasts.

                      Chuck Norris can convince everyone that the colour of the
                      bikeshed should be his favourite colour.

                      Chuck Norris finished building the bike-shed by the time
                      people stopped arguing what its colour should be.

                      Chuck Norris makes sure his ciphers are unbreakable by
                      killing all the crypto experts that could possibly
                      break them.

                      Chuck Norris&#8217; ciphers were once broken. He responded
                      by breaking those individuals.

                      If a tree falls down in the middle of the forest,
                      and there's nobody in its vicinity, it will still make
                      a sound, because Chuck Norris can hear it.

                      isn&#8217;t good, you&#8217;ll be dead.

                      The reason the Messiah has not come yet, is because

                      The Zeroth Rule of Fight Club is that Chuck Norris can
                      talk about Fight Club. No one tells Chuck Norris what
                      not to do.

                      The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to
                      the power of the Force. The power of the Force is
                      insignificant next to the wrath of Chuck Norris.

                      Chuck Norris does not believe in Astrology, despite the
                      fact that he is a Pisces, and Pisces always believe in
                      Astrology.

                      Everybody has their pet peeve. Except Chuck Norris.  He
                      can never become irritated. When somebody does something
                      Chuck Norris disapproves of, he calmly kills them, and
                      then goes on with the rest of his life.

                    Chuck Norris won't kill you for money. He also won't
                    kill you for a shitload of money. However, he might
                    opt to kill you as a free-of-charge service, knowing
                    that ridding the world of scum like you, will pay
                    him back in spades later on.

                    Chuck Norris will kill you just for the fun of kicking your
                    Death's ass till it runs away, then beating your soul back
                    into your corpse.

                    Chuck Norris was challenged to fight the world, and
                    accepted. He bet on himself, won, and collected the

                    Chuck Norris actually died and became a badass

                    If you do not like these factoids, Chuck Norris
                    will still love you. However, it's not going
                    to stop him from killing you, because
                    he doesn't let his feelings get in the way
                    of his day-to-day business.

                    Chuck Norris can destroy the world instantaneously.
                    However, he prefers it to suffer from a long,
                    slow, cruel, torture.

                    Chuck Norris coerced God into giving him the source code of
                    the universe, but then destroyed it because real
                    programmers can alter binaries directly.

                      vampires, because her kisses are deadly for them. And
                      that includes those that she blows in the air.

                      and prove that the grass is green, that there are about
                      365 days in a year, and that Isaac Newton formulated the
                      Law of Gravitation back in 1687.

                      Playing Hermione in the Harry Potter films was a dirty

                      Emma Watson does not have 10 years of experience in
                      developing Enterprise Java software. However, she has
                      over 10 years of experience in getting shit done - well,
                      on schedule, and at a reasonable cost.

                    It might seem preposterous to believe Emma Watson is the
                    new Arnold Schwarzenegger just because they were both
                    Hollywood's best paid actors and you would be right. Emma
                    Watson is not the new Arnold Schwarzenegger.

                <p>
                    You may have thought fan idolisation such as this one has
                    destroyed Emma Watson's career. But a sexy actress (or
                    actor) like her would have been "doomed" in the
                    professional Hollywood no matter what.  Instead, Emma now
                    is actually relieved, and uses her earlier reputation to
                    become a happier, sexier, and much more productive amateur
                    actress, who plays in roles she considers attractive no
                    matter how unlike her traditional Hollywood image. She has enough self control to be pleasant and
                    friendly most of the times, but if you're stretching her
                    patience, she
                    will get a little mad and you'll be surprised how insanely
                    violent she can be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Her opinions about Hollywood who gave her worse and worse
                    treatment, not despite the fact, but because they paid her,
                    can be unprintable if you like her to go that far, though
                    she can easily be "scientific" and controlled about that
                    too.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    Hollywood will either switch to <a href="http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html">the amateur model</a> -
                     or implode with or
                    without her help and the world will be a much better,
                    happier, productive, and even more profitable place.

                    fluff.

                    Emma Watson <b>will</b> get out of bed for less than
                    200,000 USD per day. That is because she always gets out of
                    bed, to seize the day, even if it is an idle one.

                    When Emma Watson makes love to her significant other, they
                    are both satisfied after the first kiss. But they carry on.

                    Emma Watson played Hermione in the Harry Potter films, but
                    she doesn&#8217;t need a wand to kick your ass. On the other
                    hand, when equipped with a wand, she'll be able to tear you
                    down to small shreds.

                      The NSA has a patent for an efficient process for
                      collecting a lot of information and doing nothing with
                      it.

                      The Bajoran scholars have positively identified Benjamin
                      Sisko as The Emissary. They also positively identified
                      the NSA headquarters as The Dungeon.

                      Hackers bend the rules, so the NSA hates them. Instead,
                      the NSA accumulates rules, observes them, and accepts
                      their fate: death.

                      people are not in their right mind.

                        Not only are the NSA agents afraid of their own

                        they have

                      Chuck Norris ability to destroy is only matched (and
                      exceeded) by Summer Glau&#8217;s ability to undo his
                      destruction.

                      When it comes to terminators, you have a better shot at

                      Chuck Norris can construct any logical expression using
                      only AND gates.  Summer Glau can replace Chuck with a
                      very small AND gate.

                      awesomest of them all?" and if the mirror tells her
                      something else, she destroys it for daring to lie to her.

                      finds a new zero-day WordPress SQL injection exploit, and
                      uses it to insert the comment into the database directly,

                        Chuck Norris once refactored a 10 million lines C++
                        program and was done by lunch time. It then took
                        Summer Glau 5 minutes to write the equivalent Perl
                        10-liner.

                    Summer Glau can kill everyone else using her mind, and start
                    a superior race. However, she finds inferior humans to be mildly
                    entertaining and challenging.

                    If Chuck Norris were to screw hot babes (ex. Jessica Alba,
                    Jessica Simpson, Jennifer Garner, Jennifer Aniston, and
                    Paris Hilton.) I can assure you that that their acting
                    careers will no longer prosper due to the fact that they
                    will spend the rest of their lives in wheelchairs.

                  If Apple ever tried to sue Taylor Swift for
                  trademark violations of Apple Swift, they will spend
                  all their money on litigation, and still lose. This
                  will make many lawyers richer, and the world a better
                  place.

                    You might think Taylor Swift is not crazy enough to
                    go after Apple for violating her trademark, but you'd
                    be wrong. She is far more crazy than that. But she
                    just doesn't give a damn.

                    If you meet Taylor Swift on the street, have a pleasant
                    conversation with her, and you need some money and ask
                    her, she'll
                    tell you: &#8220;Sure! I don't use Bitcoin because I
                    value my time, energy and happiness too much - and those
                    of the world's!
                    But I've got $1,000 and $100 bills, and have
                    a credit card if you need less. I can use PayPal on
                    my smartphone, or
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_for_Worldwide_Interbank_Financial_Telecommunication">SWIFT</a>.

                    <p>
                    &#8220;So&#8230;&#8221; she'll add, &#8220;&#8230;how much money do you want?&#8221;
                    </p>

                    <p>

                    If you ask Taylor Swift "What is the square root

                    Taylor Swift will not even consider learning and writing
                    Enterprise Java code, even for free, because it will be a
                    grand waste of time. She can learn python and
                    possibly perl fairly easily (assuming she hasn't already)
                    but she'll always use search engines and Stackoverflow /
                    StackExchange / etc. a lot.

                      Only three things are infinite: the universe, human
                      stupidity, and the amount of patience that Windows Update
                      requires.

                      Windows Update does not take forever to finish updating
                      your computer. It takes at least forever and two weeks.

                      Ten measures of slowness went down to the world.  Windows
                      Update required at least eleven, so more had to be
                      provided.

                      The Windows Update developers are going to burn in
                      hell for the combined time it took it to install updates
                      on the users' computers.

                  Windows Update is called this way because by the time
                  it finishes, the date has gone up.

                      The KGB used to torture their victims by having them
                      look at scrolling XSLT code.

                      We have nothing to fear but fear itself. Fear has nothing
                      to fear but XSLT.

                      The devil created a 10th circle of hell for the inventors
                      of XSLT, because the first nine circles were too mild for
                      them.

                      XSLT isn't like violence. XSLT is violence - there is no
                      such thing as using it too little.
