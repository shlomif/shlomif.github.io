A Jewish Deduction

The Bible dictates that “Thou shalt not seethe [= cook] a kid [= young goat]
in his mother’s milk”. To avoid any possibility of breaking that regulation,
the Jewish tradition ruled that it also applies to female goats, to mature
goats, and to the meat and milk of two completely unrelated goats. It is also
forbidden to eat the meat with fresh milk, and it applies to beef and mutton
as well (including mixing the milk and meat of two different beasts). Finally,
chicken, which are incapable of milk production, may not be eaten along with
any mammal’s milk either.

We are fortunate that most mathematicians were not Jewish. Otherwise, it would
have been forbidden to divide by all numbers between -1 and 1.

Visual C++ 5.0, to HTML a major step in advancing our project.

As a complementary step, some of the chief heads of our project suggested that
the Windows’ manuals themselves, as well as all of Microsoft’s ads, will be
designed in HTML and printed after being rendered by IE 4. While this project
is in the preliminary and planning stages, we expect it to acquire a large
momentum soon.

Yeah and what are the offerings of the open-source world? Let’s see:

How girly is that? 3. Eric S. Raymond - a nice looking man with a moustache.
Baby faced, so he looks a bit girly to me. 4. Larry Wall - a cross between
Linus and RMS (i.e: a hippy dweeb) that is even more girly.

Are you kidding?

CVS is not advanced as:

1. Microsoft Visual SourceSafe - the only sane choice for good data integrity
and portability.

2. tarballs/zip-files and patches. This one excels in convenience, and
robustness.

CVS is a very advanced version control system, however. I do wish that
Subversion (which is a VCS that I have to use against my will) was as good as
it is.

A few weeks ago, I’ve been to Freenode’s #perl, talking to merlyn and other
guys, when we got to discuss the Biblical "Tower of Babel Myth". As it turned
out, the commonly perceived interpretation was not the one most scholars find
as more sensible, which is the one we ended up being taught at Junior High
School.

What most people think is something like that:

<<<

The people spoke to each other in the same language, concentrated in one
place, and decided to build a tower high enough so they can reach God. God, a
small dwarf who lived in the sky, was afraid of the efforts of these people,
because he feared they’ll reach him. So he cast an 8th level Spell of Language
Fragmentation, caused these people to speak in different tongues, and without
being able to understand each other, they ended up spreading across the Earth.
God was relieved and returned to his dwarfish deeds, as dwarfs do.

No. 1 is true, naturally. No. 2 is not true - I know LISP but I prefer Perl.
Other like Python, etc. The reasons I don’t prefer LISP are:

1. The standards of Common LISP and Scheme don’t define anything practical.
2. LISP is at the moment incredibly verbose.
3. As Larry Wall noted, all LISP code comes in parenthesis and so it all looks
the same. (Perl is the exact opposite in this regard).
4. I cannot make heads nor tails of serious LISP code. Many LISPers create so
many macros and use them along with regular LISP code, so you keep having to
refer to the previous definitions, and make a lot of research to get you
started.

SICP Scheme is easy and fun. But serious LISP code can take too much time to
understand. OTOH, recently I had little problem reading the source code of
other Perl programmers, and extending it or fixing bugs. (likewise for
Python).

A few days ago I joined #mandriva on Freenode trying to get to the bottom of a

inside it. I asked my question and soon afterwards received:

* One Thunderbird recommendation.

* Two Evolution recommendations.

* One Sylpheed Claws recommendation.

* One GMail recommendation.

The problem is that I wasn’t interested to learn about alternative E-mail
clients, and just wanted to get my problem solved. And in GMail’s case it was
completely out of the question due to my work’s constraints.

I recently had to figure out how to do something with wget: get everything
below a directory on the web-server, without following links to outside it. So
I logged in to Freenode’s #debian channel, where there are many knowledgeable
people to ask it. The first answer I got was "RTFM". So, I read the wget man
page, but could not find it there. Eventually, after telling people that it
would be faster to give an answer, I got a reply ( add the -np -r flags). But
this has been the last straw.

I composed my own acronym. Just like RTFM is "Read the Fabulous Manual" and
STFW is "Search the Fabulous Web", then JATFM is "Just Answer the Fabulous
Man". It means that it’s usually faster to answer someone’s question than to
ask him to RTFM, which is just going to annoy him. I think the RTFM mantra has
done a lot of damage in the UNIX/Linux world, and I hope JATFMing would prove
to be a more healthy ideology.

I don’t suppose we should propose that as an alternative to Perl gods, there
should at least be Perl saints:

http://www.stallman.org/saint.html

Of course, I’m not sure what being a Perl saint would imply. Using nothing but
Perl? (Including not C in which perl 5 is written?)

Oh well.

  <rindolf>  p13: do you write scripts?
      <p13>  rindolf, init scripts and sys maintenance scripts in csh sh
             and bash
      <p13>  but i suck
      <p13>  haha
      <p13>  i made them SO unreadable on purpose too
      <p13>  my var names for example
      <p13>  i would use random quotes from coworkers
      <p13>  like "wereoutofcoffee"

      <p13>  etc etc
 <trashguy>  i hate people like you p13
      <p13>  trashguy, hahaha
 <trashguy>  at least the variables are obvious and not mistaken for
             functions and shit
 <elgrande>  i strongly recommend to call variables only: var1, var2, var3
             ... var999
 <elgrande>  but for purpose of clarity, after var999 continue with varB1,
             varB2,...

             only: var1, var2, var3 ... var999 - excellent advice.
  <rindolf>  elgrande: LOL.
 <elgrande>  rindolf: and of course: cls1, func1, meth1, if1

it kept getting stuck and we lost all our data. We had to reboot it.

B: You used Windows 95! Lucky Bastard! When I was your age, we used DOS on CGA

environment.

C: You had DOS with graphics? Lucky bastard! When I was your age, I used
VT-100 terminals connected to a VAX. 128 characters should be enough for
everybody?

D: Visual Terminals? When I was your age, we used teletypes on a PDP-11: the
computer printed on paper - very slowly. Can you imagine cat’ing a really long
document?

E: Teletypes were heaven compared to the punch cards that I was using. Imagine
going over to the computer with a large amount of punch cards and then
dropping them all.

F: Punch cards! What is this talk about punch cards? We input machine code
directly using buttons and LEDs.

     <rindolf>  scorchsaber+=1
       <rillo>  ??
     <rindolf>  rillo: Python does not have a ++ operator.
 <scorchsaber>  rindolf: Oh, but it does have a + operator.
       <rillo>  ah. I’m new to python so i did not know
 <scorchsaber>  A few days ago, it was suggested that I implement ++ using
                the + operator.
 <scorchsaber>  And I did so. :)
 <scorchsaber>  So, really, a++; is valid in Python, and it may even
                increment a by one. If somebody was crazy, anyhow, and if
                a was mutable.
       <rillo>  shall i move back to perl to get the ++

  <TimToady>  no, English was my first language. :)
   <rindolf>  TimToady: I started with XT ROM BASIC, but I suppose it was
              something like Perl 5 was to Perl 4 for your BASIC.
   <rindolf>  BASIC has greatly evolved since Dartmouth BASIC.
   <rindolf>  TimToady: ah.

     <Juerd>  21:04 <@TimToady> we have a test suite right now because of

     <Juerd>  Very, very important.
   <rindolf>  diakopter: I don't know.
   <rindolf>  Juerd: yes, very.
   <rindolf>  Juerd: anyway, I expect that at every given time all tests
              will pass.
     <Juerd>  Well, there are probably bad tests too :)
     <Juerd>  Given the volume of the suite, and that pugs has never been

   <rindolf>  How long does it take Pugs to run the entire Pugs test

  <pmurias>  rindolf: what is Park/Spark?
  <rindolf>  pmurias:
             http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/Park-Lisp/
  <rindolf>  pmurias: it's still incomplete.
  <rindolf>  And I haven't updated it.
  <pmurias>  rindolf: if you like lisp/perl6 projects you might consider
             helping with a common lisp elf backend
  <rindolf>  pmurias: Common Lisp.
  <rindolf>  pmurias: thing is I think both CL and Scheme suck.
  <rindolf>  I like Lisp as a concept.
  <rindolf>  Arc is nice, but has too many implementation problems.
  <rindolf>  And missing features.
    <vixey>  Arc is not nice
  <rindolf>  I want to give a presentation to the Perl Mongers about
             "Foreign Languages: Lisp"
  <rindolf>  vixey: I like it.
  <rindolf>  Though I hate that "(not)" has become "(no)"
  <rindolf>  it's so non-English.
    <vixey>  it's just Tcl with horrible syntax
  <rindolf>  vixey: but it's missing a lot of exciting features.
  <rindolf>  Which PG deemed as unnecessary.
  <rindolf>  Doesn't look like the 100-years language to me.
  <rindolf>  Which is why - Spark!
  <pmurias>  why not just write an s-expression p6 dialect?
  <rindolf>  pmurias: could be.
  <rindolf>  pmurias: it's another approach.
  <rindolf>  But some things make sense in Lisp and not in p6.
  <rindolf>  For example, Perl does not like to use + for string or list
             concat.
  <rindolf>  While Python does and it seems to be OK in Arc too.
  <rindolf>  And in CL you have (concatenate) (yuck!).
  <pbuetow>  (((hehe)))
  <pmurias>  + for strings sucks
    <Auzon>  seconded.
    <vixey>  rindolf: If you don't like CONCATENATE you can just rename it
  <rindolf>  vixey: yeah.
  <rindolf>  vixey: but I'd rather not rename concatenate because then
             people won't understand my code.
  <rindolf>  vixey: as TimToady said people hate abstractions.
    <vixey>  yes they will rindolf
  <rindolf>  They want things to work out of the box.
    <vixey>  A program is many many totally newly defined procedures
    <vixey>  just renaming one thing is nothing in the context of a big
             program
  <rindolf>  vixey: "let's spend 3 days creating a new language, and 1 day
             implementing the solution with it."
 <TimToady>  if it would take 10 days without the new language, it's worth
             it
  <rindolf>  TimToady: yeah.
  <rindolf>  TimToady: but this is the CL mentality.
    <vixey>  no it's not
  <rindolf>  Sometimes you can take 1 day to write an API.
    <vixey>  CL is too diverse you cannot generalize like that
  <rindolf>  vixey: I meant a common idiom there.
  <rindolf>  I think I'll /quit and do something productive.
  <rindolf>  Like work on Spark.
    <vixey>  another quote:
    <vixey>  how to write any computer program in two easy stages:
    <vixey>  Design and implement the programming language which would be
             best for solving the problem.
    <vixey>  Write the program in the language you’ve just implemented.
  <rindolf>  vixey: or just use Perl which is the best for everything.
    <vixey>  heh
 <TimToady>  the second step is obvious--the best language for the job is
             one that does the job on a null input
          *  pmichaud notes that vixey's algorithm is somewhat recursive
 <TimToady>  "All rules of thumb are false, including this one."
  <pmurias>  rindolf: when you feel like writing Common Lisp backends,
             contact me or mncharity ;)

you know.

Which may lead to interesting philosophical issues. BTW, in a conference I was

They still have some issue with the retrieval procedures, but besides of that
- they are quite a trusted service.

Richard M. Stallman (RMS) decides to release his brand-new editor, "Emacs" on
the CPAN with its first version 29.999.99. In order to package it, he invokes
the trusty ol’ module-starter (see
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Module-Starter/) which creates a skeleton of a
CPAN distribution for him.

He fills in the skeleton with the actual code of Emacs, types "perl Build.PL",
and "./Build test" and makes sure all the tests pass. Then he types "./Build
config --gui" and gets a nice GUI to configure the various parameters of the
Module meta-data.[M-B-Data]

In the GUI, Richard goes to the Trove categorisation tab, and selects
categories. This is done in a similar way to Freshmeat’s project
categorisation dialog (a list of options to the left, with selected options to
the right and arrows to move them left or right, while allowing multiple
select options.). He chooses such categories as "Programming Language ::
Lisp", and "Intended Audience :: Emacs Users", "Operating System :: GNU", and
"Topic :: Editors". (Note: I believe the category list should be fetched using
a public web-service to keep them up-to-date.)

After several weeks of having the editor on CPAN, Richard has received many
patches, and wrote a lot of code on his own. Now Emacs is not only an editor
but a calendar tool, an Eliza program, a web browser, a mail user agent and
many other things.

So in order to release version 30.000.00 he needs to update the
categorisation. He runs ./Build config --gui again, and adds more categories.
However, he enters too many categories (because Emacs now does them all), and
the GUI refuses to save the file because it will overflow the limit that the
web-service specified the CPAN classification services allow to handle. So
Richard keeps only the important categories, adds more tags, and saves it.

He then tests the distribution again, and uploads the new distribution to the
CPAN.

Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft decides to use Richard Stallman’s Emacs as the
basis of his company’s state-of-the-art product Microsoft Editing Macros™
Enterprise Edition XP .NET Professional. However since MS Editing Macros™ is a
commercial, proprietary program which he intends to sell at computer stores,
Bill is not going to upload it to the CPAN. He builds upon Emacs, sends
patches to Richard and learns a lot about it.

When he’s finished building Microsoft Editing Macros™ he surfs to the Emacs
homepage on CPAN, and adds some categories and tags of his own.

Eventually, enough people like Bill tag and categorise Emacs, and it gains
more classification.

       <ik>  Two words! Four, if you count "no". Twice.
  <rindolf>  Yes, it sounded French to me too.

1) did you use the correct argument order? if you’re a good programmer, use
the *reverse* from what you think it is. see if it works. no? you’re not a
good programmer, or you learned PHP’s braindeadness and can go on to step 2).

2) did you think about your code? if so, don’t. PHP will do it for you so you
can do mindbogglingly stupid stuff, such as not escape the data that goes into
your SQL queries.

  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yes, I played with Squeak a little and yes I'd like
             a vim clone written in perl.
  <Makoryu>  Why isn't there one already, then?
  <Makoryu>  (A vim clone in Perl)
  <Su-Shee>  good question. there's one in javascript :)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: actually , it's a vi clone.
  <rindolf>  Writing a vi clone is much easier than writing a vim clone.
  <rindolf>  Just like writing a Scheme clone is much easier than writing
             a Perl 6 implementation.
  <rindolf>  Unless you're Chuck Norris.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: darn.. he already wrote a vim in perl6?
  <moritz_>  no, he scared K&R into writing it ;-)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: Chuck Norris is the ghost author of the entire
             Debian GNU/Linux distribution.
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: and he wrote it in 24 hours, while taking snack
             breaks.
  <Su-Shee>  rindolf: yes, I know - he published Slackware under the
             pseudonym Patrick Volkerding...
  <rindolf>  Chuck Norris read the entire Wikipedia. Twice.
   <araujo>  the second time includes fixing all its errors
  <moritz_>  but he didn't commit his changes, it seems
  <rindolf>  moritz_: heh.
  <rindolf>  LOL.
   <araujo>  Chuck Norris doesn't commit changes, the changes commit for
             him
   <araujo>  :)
  <rindolf>  Code is too scared of Chuck to be wrong.
  <rindolf>  It is generated right in the first time.
  <rindolf>  Bugs are too afraid to reproduce on Chuck Norris' computer.
  <Su-Shee>  .o(I see a Chuck Norris release on the horizon... ;)
  <rindolf>  Su-Shee: :-)
  <Su-Shee>  we could ask Chuck Norris if he's willing to promote the star
             release.. ;)) (which probably kill the entire internet due to
             laughter.. :)

  <Su-Shee>  rakudo - chuck's choice ;)
  <Su-Shee>  well, Camelia and Chuck Norris go well together. ;)
  <rindolf>  OK.
  <rindolf>  Of course everybody know Chuck Norris is a real programmer.
  <rindolf>  He designs machines by combining individual atoms.
  <rindolf>  Using his thought.
  <rindolf>  Atoms obey Chuck Norris.

 <shlomif>  But he's not always funny.
 <shlomif>  IRL, he's really funny.
 <shlomif>  He gives funny presentations.
   <sjors>  I don't have the place in ottd to *force* them to do the right
            thing, but they do stuff like making 90 degree corners,
            stopping three other trains in their tracks, just because it's

 <whoppix>  Quick git question, perhaps someone knows the answer: I have a
            file in my git tree (locally and in the repository), but I
            want git to ignore the file completely, i.e. git is not to
            touch the file on the file system by updating it or merging
            local changes into the repository
 <rindolf>  whoppix: you can use .gitignore
 <rindolf>  I think
 <whoppix>  rindolf, hmm, good idea, thanks.
 <whoppix>  that was slow.
 <whoppix>  rindolf, hmm, I think git update-index --assume-unchanged is
            what I need.
 <whoppix>  .gitignore is only for untracked files
 <rindolf>  whoppix: OK, have no clue what that is.
 <rindolf>  Git is so complicated.
 <rindolf>  And so opaque
 <whoppix>  rindolf, me neither, but the doc tells me to use that.
 <rindolf>  whoppix: can you believe the docs?
 <rindolf>  The docs may be lying.
 <rindolf>  Don't trust the docs.
 <rindolf>  Don't trust anything.

Mike “The Mouse“ House (a.k.a “D.J. Salinger”) was a rap artist who
experienced only limited success, and a computer geek, when he decided to
start selling CDs of open-source software. He turned to spamming to publicise
his business, but realised that most of the spam messages he sent were blocked
by E-mail filters. He decided to use the notorious obscured image spam, but
since he had a few blind friends, he opted to also include an audio recording
of a rap song with the message.

House received a few offers from his spam campaign, but his real break came
when a few enthusiasts of the spam song shared it on the Internet, where it
became an instant hit. The song eventually hit the charts and MTV, and made
D.J. Salinger famous, who quickly released his first successful album called
/Rap to the spam, Ma’am!/, with such highly acclaimed hits as “Rap to not get
trapped” and “He ain’t Nigerian. He’s a Spammer!”.

As a millionaire, House decided to donate some of his money back to sponsoring
open-source projects, and has donated 100,000s of U.S. Dollars to such causes
as [the Free Software Foundation](http://www.fsf.org/), [Linux
International](http://www.li.org/) and
[SpamAssassin](http://spamassassin.apache.org/). “If it hadn’t been for them,
I wouldn’t have made it big”, he said, and said he’s now working on a second
album with a similar theme.

All languages of the world suck. If you require people to declare variables
(like in Pascal, C,
[Scheme](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_%28programming_language%29) or
Perl 5 with [strict](http://perldoc.perl.org/strict.html)), then people will
tell you they like variables to spring up upon first use. Without variable
declarations, then you get various weird side-effects of the implicit scoping.
If you use curly braces for scoping, then you’ll have to type more and there’s
more clutter. With indentation-based scoping (like in Python), you’ll find it
hard to introduce multiple-expression
[lambdas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus#First-class_functions).

Rob Pike and Paul Graham hated object oriented programming (OOP) and so they
didn’t introduce it in their
[“Go”](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29) and
[“Arc“](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arc_%28programming_language%29)
languages, well after OOP has become mainstream. And guess what? Many people,
including me, think that OOP is still a good thing (and no, in my opinion, C++
did not do OOP very well) and so gave up on Arc quickly and did not look
closely at Go.

Dynamically typed languages (like Perl 5, Python, Ruby, or Lisp) possibly
suffer from many subtle errors; Statically typed languages (like Haskell) are
less expressive and it seems that about one third of the language design
papers published on [Lambda the Ultimate](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/) are
about various funky extensions to the Haskell type system to allow for better
expressiveness.

Purely functional languages have no assignment and most people find them
harder, in part because the world around us has a lot of state, and they also
need to do funky compiler tricks to make you feel like you don’t need
assignment. Non-functional languages have side-effects and so are prone to
many errors.

If you have goto or goto-like statements (such as exceptions or Perl 5’s “last
LABEL;” (more like “break” in C) or “next LABEL;”), then you encourage code to
not be factored correctly. If you don’t have such stuff, then programmers will
hate you for having to go through many hoops to write quick-and-dirty code.

Perl 5 has a dedicated regular expression syntax which is treated magically by
the parser. PHP and Java use strings for them, and require weird escaping and
backslashing rules to interpolate the sub-regexes inside them. And if you
incorporate a first-order syntax for regular expressions, then people will
want similar first-order syntaxes for XPath, for XML (like some recent
versions of Visual Basic .NET have), and for all other grammars you may need
to embed.

Finally, many people absolutely hate all the clutter created by the leading
[sigils](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigil_%28computer_programming%29) of
Perl 5 (the "$", "@", etc.), and similar languages, but they allow for much
better backward compatibility, facilitate the so-called “interpolation” (=
embedding inside strings), and also give some important visual cues when
skimming code (even without syntax highlighting).

          <rindolf>  Hi all.
         <Leuthihi>  O HAI rindolf
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: HAI HAI.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: what's up?
         <Leuthihi>  rindolf: I'm hungry!
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: there's one antidote for it.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: it's called Food.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: </bolt>
         <Leuthihi>  well, but what food?
         <Leuthihi>  and I need coffee
         <Leuthihi>  oh, I think I know what I'll have.
 <benwbrum_chez_so>  Chili. A big bowl of red, with crackers and onions on
                     the side.
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: does it matter?
            <Volis>  If it has to be some cuisine.
            <Volis>  Did I spell correctly?
          <rindolf>  Volis: spell what?
            <Volis>  oh yes.
            <Volis>  cuisine.
          <rindolf>  "cuisine" is spelt this way.
          <rindolf>  Yes.
          <rindolf>  It's a French word I think.
          <rindolf>  .ety cuisine
           <la_fen>  "1786, from Fr. cuisine 'style of cooking,'
                     originally 'kitchen, cooking, cooked food' (12c.),
                     from L.L. cocina, earlier coquina 'kitchen,' from L.
                     coquere 'to cook' (see cook (n.))." -
                     http://etymonline.com/?term=cuisine
          <rindolf>  OK, originally from Latin.
            <Volis>  never mind. Which cuisine is the best?
            <Volis>  In general
          <rindolf>  Volis: I like many cuisines.
           <Gvidon>  Russian, of course
          <rindolf>  Volis: though most of the ethnic food is actually
                     poor men's food.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: Russian cuisine?
           <Gvidon>  rindolf: Yes
         <Leuthihi>  well, yes, because I need something to eat to be able
                     to eat it.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: what does it feature?
            <Volis>  Russian cuisine lacks flavour.
           <Gvidon>  rindolf: Vodka
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: ah.
         <Leuthihi>  In Soviet Russia, food tastes YOU!
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: I didn't know Vodka is nutritious
          <rindolf>  Leuthihi: :-)
            <Volis>  In Soviet Russia, They no longer use this meme. :P
         <Leuthihi>  Vodka has plenty of calories at least.
          <rindolf>  Gvidon: and I don't consume Alcoholic beverages in
                     any quantity.
          <rindolf>  Volis: :-)
         <Leuthihi>  Volis: because: In Soviet Russia, meme uses You!
          <rindolf>  «In Soviet Russia, cats own you. Oh wait! They own
                     you everywhere.»
            <Volis>  Considering the fact, i'm still underage. Please
                     change the topic.
          <rindolf>  Volis: underage?
          <rindolf>  Volis: ah, you cannot drink?
            <Volis>  In Soviet Russia, left keeps you. Always.
            <Volis>  "Dear fellow driver, let left be for communist crap
                     only"
            <Volis>  rindolf, Rules of the world.

 <linuxguy101>  sebsebseb: i thought you were abducted by windows 8
     <rindolf>  sebsebseb: hi.
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: windows got him
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: if you say so.
 <linuxguy101>  he is trying to find that icon in windows 8 that has irc
                on it
 <linuxguy101>  average users it usually will take a day or longer
 <linuxguy101>  it is a productivity enhancer
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: heh.
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you must get windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  it is an experience in windows you will never forget
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: why?
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: it is like windows me and vista combined with a
                bunch of retarded programmers who cant speak the same lang
 <linuxguy101>  it is jaw dropping
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: sounds fascinating.
 <linuxguy101>  i expect Microsoft will earn some rewards on this os
 <linuxguy101>  like longest boot time.. Hardest os to use by a human. And
                most compatible os with itself ever made.
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: :-)
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you must switch to something less useful and more
                productive like windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  think of the hours you could spend on windows 8.. remember
                it is retro
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: retrofitted?
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: yes.. down to 2 or 4 colors.. Steve Balmer in a
                cocaine brain storming meeting with the developers decided
                to move to a GUI that was un pattoned so they invented
                retro.. simple and stupid colors a 4 year old child could
                barely read or draw
 <linuxguy101>  he called it retro
     <rindolf>  Retro.
 <linuxguy101>  clearly a first in computing history
     <rindolf>  Now I get the joke.
     <rindolf>  Metro is Retro.
 <linuxguy101>  oh it is no joke.. just wait for windows 8 lack of sales
                prompt Steve Balmer to shove it down into the updates for
                windows 7
 <linuxguy101>  on a side note, did you know that linux is becoming more
                popular now days?
 <linuxguy101>  i don’t know why..
 <linuxguy101>  rindolf: you really should try windows 8
 <linuxguy101>  at least virtual box it..
     <rindolf>  linuxguy101: maybe I should, but I'm not going to shell
                out money for the experience.
 <linuxguy101>  Warning!: using windows 8 may cause massive hysteria,
                laughing and vomiting in some cases..
 <linuxguy101>  the first time i used windows 8 i laughed uncontrollably
                for several hours and almost wet myself

 <rindolf>  Hi all.
 <srogers>  howdy
 <rindolf>  srogers: hi, what's up?
 <srogers>  work, mostly
 <srogers>  "one of those days"
 <rindolf>  Ah.
 <rindolf>  Work.
 <rindolf>  I'm enjoying my unemployed status.
 <rindolf>  And after all that hospital thing is behind me, I'd like to go
            to tau.ac.il and set up some events where I read from my
            writings/etc.
 <rindolf>  To gain some esteem.
 <rindolf>  I contacted an Israeli publisher about publishing some of my
            stories and/or essays, but they didn't return to me after more
            than a month (which is their designated limit).
 <rindolf>  And after reminding them on the phone, I gave up.
 <rindolf>  Well, I'm not going to sit idly and expect recognition to come
            to me.
 <rindolf>  Maybe I'll use some of my Project Wonderful money to gain some
            publicity.
 <rindolf>  I could try publicising some of my works on various sites such
            as http://www.calamitiesofnature.com/
 <srogers>  Yeah - promote yourself
 <rindolf>  srogers: yes.
 <rindolf>  srogers: I think that was the main mistake of Howard Roark in
            The Fountainhead.
 <rindolf>  He should have worked more on publicity.
 <srogers>  ha - if only he had Facebook . . .
 <rindolf>  Heh.

     <mrout>  Who likes freedom?
     <mrout>  FREEDOM
   <rindolf>  mrout: freedom++
    <Younos>  just give me my beer
   <rindolf>  Younos: heh.
   <rindolf>  No beer for you!
    <Younos>  aww :o(
     <mrout>  I’m in non-freedom mode atm actually, using Windoze
     <mrout>  for the gamez
   <rindolf>  mrout: OK.
     <mrout>  but when I restart into Linux I respect the freedoms of
              myself and others
   <rindolf>  mrout: OK.
    <Younos>  you should respect it regardless of the platform
   <rindolf>  mrout: maybe try reporting it as a bug in WINE/etc.
   <rindolf>  mrout: the GNU project encourages FOSS developers to port
              their software to non-free platforms.
   <rindolf>  Though there was a small backlash about it (at least for
              Windows) a while ago.
 <alfplayer>  encourages?
     <mrout>  rindolf: I sure hope it does. if we can encourage users to
              try FOSS software on non-free platforms, they might more
              easily learn about FOSS and about how to protect their
              freedoms
   <rindolf>  http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/download.html - I provide a
              Windows binary for this. :-)
     <mrout>  Many users don’t even know they can get software that
              respects their freedoms.
   <rindolf>  alfplayer: well, don't know if encourage, but it doesn't
              hold a stand against it.
   <rindolf>  alfplayer: and a lot of GNU software can be built fine on
              Windows (And proprietary UNIXes).
 <alfplayer>  rindolf: that's very different imo
 <alfplayer>  rindolf: yes, like gcc and emacs
     <mrout>  btw is rms ever on here? He gave a talk at my local
              university a few years ago, and I never got a chance to talk
              to him.

              - also see this.
     <mrout>  LOL
   <rindolf>  mrout: I don't think he uses IRC.
   <rindolf>  mrout: he also doesn't use a graphical web browser.
   <rindolf>  mrout: though he does read the web sometimes.
     <mrout>  rindolf: i haven’t installed X yet, so neither do I. haha
   <rindolf>  He commented on a few pages on my site.
   <rindolf>  When he visited Israel, I told RMS that I felt making
              Freecell Solver Public Domain (now it's MIT/X11L) was
              appropriate given its target audience, and he said he
              thought making it GPLed would encourage more users of
              programs that used it to make them FOSS.
   <rindolf>  He also said it was OK that freshmeat.net (now freecode.com)
              did not release their backend as free software.
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
     <mrout>  freecode.com?
   <rindolf>  mrout: well, I think he doesn't even use links or lynx or
              Emacs' www-mode.
   <rindolf>  mrout: yes.
   <rindolf>  mrout: they changed their name and domain.
     <mrout>  who are they? NEVER heard of them
   <rindolf>  mrout: http://freecode.com/ - it's a nice way to discover
              some interesting software.
   <rindolf>  mrout: they are a web-directory for UNIX software.
     <mrout>  do they host it?
   <rindolf>  mrout: no.
     <mrout>  quite unlike something like github, then?
   <rindolf>  mrout: just link to it.
     <mrout>  cool
     <mrout>  will try to remember that
   <rindolf>  mrout: also see
              http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Freecell-Solver/slides/freshmeat_effect.html
   <rindolf>  mrout: not everything there is FOSS.
      <mtjm>  http://stallman.org/stallman-computing.html explains his Web
              use
   <rindolf>  mrout: and not everything is there.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but I try to publicise most of my major software
              there.
      <mtjm>  IRC would need a constant network access which is difficult
              when travelling (and needs much more time than batch mail
              writing)
   <rindolf>  Well, most of the software published there is either niche
              or quite boring.
     <mrout>  rindolf: Freecell Solver on freecode is the first result
   <rindolf>  mrout: for what?
     <mrout>  that google search
     <mrout>  I fail to see a problem
   <rindolf>  mrout: well, thing is there are other Freecell solvers.
   <rindolf>  mrout: and what I said is that I clog the search.
     <mrout>  Oh, I see what you mean
     <mrout>  that’s a good thing for you, though
   <rindolf>  mrout: lots of junk like
              FreeBSD/Debian/Ubuntu/Mandriva/Mageia packages.
   <rindolf>  mrout: that's what I call the freshmeat effect.
   <rindolf>  I get http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/ as the first hit. :-(

     <mrout>  New Zealand.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but shlomifish.org is hosted in hostgator.com .
   <rindolf>  I used to host it in a small Israeli hosting provider but
              they were too unreliable.
     <mrout>  I asked, because i expected it to be US, and so I’d say “I
              know what US stands for, but you don’t know what NZ stands
              for? Shame on you.”
   <rindolf>  mrout: I know that .nz is New Zealand.
   <rindolf>  mrout: but didn't understand the initialism in the context.
   <rindolf>  mrout: some Americans think .il is Illinois.
   <rindolf>  And .ca is California.
   <rindolf>  Well, there's also .la.
     <mrout>  ahh

     <mrout>  yeah

   <rindolf>  There should be a country called .if so I can register

   <rindolf>  Someone registered shlomifi.sh. ;-)
   <rindolf>  Not me, though.
   <rindolf>  https://www.google.com/search?q=.lf - no .lf either.
   <rindolf>  We need more countries.
     <mrout>  I wish there was a .ut
     <mrout>  so I could get mro.ut
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
   <rindolf>  Well, I can register shlomif.name.
     <mrout>  I already have rout.co.nz (that’s my dad’s actually) and
              rout.geek.nz (mine)
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah.
   <rindolf>  Are top-level .nz domains available?
   <rindolf>  like rout.nz
     <mrout>  you can’t get milesroutisawesome.nz, no
   <rindolf>  Ah.
     <mrout>  or rout.nz >.>
   <rindolf>  OK.
   <rindolf>  .il domains are kinda costly and they used to require
              faxing.
   <rindolf>  And I don't feel my domains are particularly
              Israeli-related.
     <mrout>  ahh
   <rindolf>  Well, I originally got shlomif.il.eu.org.
   <rindolf>  But its DNS was flaky.
     <mrout>  .eu.org?
   <rindolf>  So I ended up buying shlomifish.org
     <mrout>  what’s your actual name?
   <rindolf>  Now I also have shlomifish.com
   <rindolf>  mrout: Shlomi Fish.
     <mrout>  Ahh
   <rindolf>  mrout: eu.org is free DNS.
     <mrout>  ?
   <rindolf>  But I guess you get what you pay for sometimes.
   <rindolf>  mrout: it's not .eu (European union).
   <rindolf>  mrout: http://eu.org/
     <mrout>  that site’s odd
     <mrout>  what’s wrong with .eu
     <mrout>  shit a brick, they want a separate ccTLD for
              http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Martin_(France)
   <rindolf>  mrout: nothing is wrong with .eu - it's just that eu.org is
              something different.
   <rindolf>  eu.org predates .eu.
     <mrout>  ahh
     <mrout>  it annoys me that the US doesn’t use .us more
     <mrout>  and clutters .com
   <rindolf>  Well, there's also .gov, .net, .org...
   <rindolf>  .mil
   <rindolf>  .navy
     <mrout>  exactly
   <rindolf>  mrout: I also have http://shlom.in/
     <mrout>  it’s pretty americo-centric
   <rindolf>  Could not get http://shlom.fi/ because my domain registrar
              did not have it.
   <rindolf>  shlom.in is my own custom (and private) URL shortener.
   <rindolf>  Some overzealous spam filters blocked it.
   <rindolf>  Ah, domains.
   <rindolf>  The bread and butter of Internet conversations.
     <mrout>  LOL
   <rindolf>  I know someone who has http://ali.as/
   <rindolf>  Well, from the Internet.
   <rindolf>  And there's also cr.yp.to which is Dan Bernstein.
   <rindolf>  DJB.
     <mrout>  domains, vim vs emacs and hello_there vs helloThere.
     <mrout>  cr.yp.to is cool
   <rindolf>  mrout: and tabs vs. spaces.
     <mrout>  but hard to type
     <mrout>  eugh
     <mrout>  cr.yp.to is hard to type
     <mrout>  spaces, vim, hello_there or HelloThere, but never
              helloThere.
   <rindolf>  Since I have http://perl-begin.org/ and want to create a
              site for Vim beginners, I should get a good domain.
   <rindolf>  vim.perl-begin.org or vim.shlomifish.org does not look good.

     <mrout>  they deleted your user page?

   <rindolf>  There are a zillion pages about it.
   <rindolf>  And Wikipedia covers almost any other Solitaire variant.

   <rindolf>  Yes.

              not "Encyclopedic enough."
   <rindolf>  mrout: that Wikipedian had tons of complaints against him on

   <rindolf>  mrout: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen - this
              used to be about the Perl developer (and co-author of

   <rindolf>  Now it's about an olympic athelete.
   <rindolf>  Well, I added that page, and people enhanced it, but then it

     <mrout>  not even an olympic athelete
   <rindolf>  mrout: ah, yes, just world competition.

I recall discussing Buffy with a Jewish American friend, who used to be
secular, and now has become an observant Jew, and married a woman who properly
converted to Orthodox Judaism, and they have some children. We discussed the
fact that Sarah Michelle Gellar was Jewish, and yet that many men (and some
Lesbian women) were more attracted to Alyson Hannigan’s character, Willow
Rosenberg, who was a shy and sheepish, redhead, Jewess. Then when I mentioned
that Hannigan was only a maternal Jew, he said she is “kosher” (because
someone whose mother is Jewish and who did not convert to a different
religion, is a bona-fide Jew). I found it amusing that you refer to women by
the same word as you do to food, but I think the ancient Hebrew word "kasher"
also means "approved", "appropriate", "legal", etc.

In any case, both Hannigan and Gellar are now married, and so trying to
separate between them and their husbands is not kosher. ;-)

[There are three young men dressed as Klingons who fight with Bat’leth in the
park. Selina is passing by and shakes her head in disapproval. The three
notice Selina, and quickly run to her.]

Warrior #1: Hail The Slayer, we are but your humble slaves!

Selina: [Shocked] And who might you be?

Warrior #1: We are The Three - three vampire brother warriors, who have been
fighting since the dawn of time.

Selina: And you are Klingons…

Warrior #2: We can assume any form.

Warrior #1: Yes, we can fight using any weapon, and we are masters of them
all.

Selina: so you can fight with something that’s not a Bat’leth?

Warrior #1: Of course, for example, we could fight using the Huge Sword!

Warrior #2 and Warrior #3: Yeah, the Huge Sword!

The Three: [in unison] Huge Sword!

[Warrior #1 snaps his fingers, and some of these ridiculously large swords
from World of Warcraft appear on the ground.]

Selina: Wow, can you fight using them?

The Three: [non-dramatically] Eh, eh, we cannot lift them.

Selina: Guess not. [Puts her palm on her eyes.] Maybe try something smaller
and not as heavy.

Warrior #2: Yes, smaller.

Warrior #3: And not as heavy.

Warrior #1: You're not thinking about the smallest… yet deadliest weapon for a
mighty vampire warrior… the wooden toothpick!

[The three cry “yeah”. Warrior #1 snaps his fingers and the huge swords are
replaced by small wooden toothpicks.]

Selina: Toothpicks? Have you blokes been watching too much Sesame Street?

Warrior #1: Why, of course! Every mighty Klingon warrior has watched Sesame
Street.

Selina: Mighty Klingon vampire warriors who have watched Sesame Street… this
decade royally sucks!!

The Israelites and the Philistines schedule a large battle. The Philistines
have far superior equipment with armours made out of iron, which the
Israelites don’t have. Eventually, Goliath, a tall Philistine giant, steps
forward and asks for an Israelite man worthy enough to fight him and determine
the fate of the battle (something which was quite common in the ancient Near
East). It seems the Israelites will lose the battle.

Out of nowhere, a young Israelite boy whom hardly anyone knew about steps
forward with a sling and a few pebbles. Goliath thinks this is ridiculous and
ridicules him. However, the boy quickly puts a pebble in his sling, and after
rotating the sling to achieve a very large velocity (not unusual with slings)
hurls the pebble with great accuracy (also not unthinkable, because shepherds
in the Near East effectively used slings to kill lions and other predators to
their flock) into Goliath’s face, which was uncovered to allow him to see.
Even if Goliath’s shield bearer wanted to, he could not lift the huge shield
in time, and Goliath was completely not agile in his suit and armour. The
sling’s rock smashes Goliath’s brain, and he falls to the ground dead. The
Israelites have won the battle.

That boy’s name was David.

Why is it important here? Because David was a “hacker”. Why was he a hacker?
Because he knew the rules, and played by them, but knew how to bend them, in
order to earn his victory. Hackers bend the rules.

And here’s the thing: this is what an action hero is all about: he makes his
own rules, or he even breaks them, and does not accept his fate. This is
whereas a tragic hero is bound by many invisible rules, and accepts his fate,
which is, almost certainly going to be death.

And in real life, you should also aim to be a hacker or an action hero, or the
many phrases it used to be called.

Worf: Commander Dax, I explicitly prohibit you from asking about Mr. Q’s roles
as a husband and a father.

Jadzia: You are right, Commander. I’ve realised something: throughout this
whole trip through the wonders of the Q continuum I’ve been far too selfish
and only thought about myself. I should have thought about you, too.

[She turns towards Avigayil]

Jadzia: Avigayil, could you, by any chance, allow us to meet Kahless the
Unforgettable in his living dead self, I’m sure Commander Worf here would love
to meet him.

Worf: Actually, Commander, I don’t think…

Jadzia: [Interrupting him] Oh, you don’t? That’s a shame. Well, I’ll go meet
him alone (always wanted to, you know). Worf, I think Kahless will be
disappointed not to meet you, but I’ll tell him you’re a big fan of his, and
I’ll let you watch the video of me meeting him and…

Worf: [Sighs] Commander Dax, you are impossible.

Fine, let’s go meet Kahless if that’s humanly possible.

Avigayil: Sounds good. The whole mission from Deep Space Nine can go with you,
I’ll notify Kahless. He’s a big fan of a lot of you.

Amanda: OK, let’s summon Katie and her gang of no-goodnicks too. She wouldn’t
want to miss it.

Quark: Yes, and it’s high time we merged the two sub-plots in the future
movie. “Too much of a good thing is a bad thing. But only for your customers”.

   <ZetaNeta>  i wonder, if one day, developers will lose the possibility
               to write code no one else can understand.
   <ZetaNeta>  If CPUs will start running interpretable code
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: you can always obfuscate code.
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: nothing guarantees that a code will be readable.
   <ZetaNeta>  yeah, that is why i wish people will lose the ability to
               write unreadable code
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: and there's also
               https://github.com/kripken/emscripten which compiles from
               C/C++/ObjC/etc. to unreadable JS.
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: how will you guarantee that?
   <ZetaNeta>  I cant. Thats why i wish
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: have you heard of the
               http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem ?
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: it may be impossible for a computer to do.
    <rindolf>  ZetaNeta: if not for a human too.

               stuff.

            *  ZetaNeta doesn’t like to mix software with philosophy, to

               casts many doubts about a machine's (or a human's) ability

               is easy to understand or not, and so you might as well
               forget about it.

      <rindolf>  Hi all.
       <Bucket>  hi rindolf
      <rindolf>  Lately, I have been thinking that maybe some of the
                 Snowden leaks are actually the "achievements" of maniacal
                 minds ( https://duckduckgo.com/Mania ) and don't work
                 well in practise or at all.
      <rindolf>  Probably most of the NSA workers are either depressive,
                 maniacal or schizophrenic by now.
      <rindolf>  Althir: awesome.
       <Bucket>  Wicked!
      <rindolf>  Is Bucket a bot?
       <Bucket>  no, I'm a folk singer
       <Althir>  ferret: Is Bucket real?
 <flyingferret>  Certainly not.
     <barometz>  You're all just imagining Bucket, then
      <rindolf>  Heh, heh.
      <rindolf>  I'm not real either.
      <rindolf>  «For all you know, you may not exist and Summer Glau
                 convinced you that you do.»
      <rindolf>  ;-)

       <Althir>  I'd let Summer Glau convince me I'm alive.
      <rindolf>  Althir: heh.
      <rindolf>  Althir: I don't need to be convinced of that.
      <rindolf>  Althir: would you let Chuck Norris convince you that
                 you're alive? ;-)
      <rindolf>  I wouldn't , but not sure I can resist.
       <Althir>  rindolf: Chuck Norris only convinces people they are
                 deceased.
      <rindolf>  Althir: heh.
      <rindolf>  Althir: what about SGlau?
       <Althir>  Chuck Norris convinced Summer Glau to kick arse.
      <rindolf>  Althir: a true warrior brings life - not death.
       <Althir>  I think you misunderstand warfare.

She and I watch it almost every week together.

let me watch one… more… episode. [giggles]

SMG: We’ve got a lot of time for that. OK: it was 1997-1998ish, Buffy started
airing and became a cult series. So, one day a group of yeshivah pupils from a
local Chabad yeshivah arrived to the studios saying they have some
numerological insights from the Jewish bible, about what will happen in
Sunnydale next.

[SGlau burst out laughing.]

SGlau: [calms down] Oh my God, that’s the craziest thing I have ever heard.

SMG: Anyway, we played along, and listened to what they had to say, and
actually got a few good ideas from that. Moreover, in one of the recesses, one
of the Yeshivah pupils asked me out, and I accepted.

So we went on a date.

SGlau: So you mean like the 1997ish Sarah Michelle Gellar, and a Yeshivah
pupil… On a date?!

SMG: Yes! And I actually had some weirder dates as a happy spinster.

Anyhow, surprisingly, it was a very nice date, I had a great time, and I
learned quite a bit.

SGlau: Heh.

SMG: And one thing he told me was that every Jew (as he said) should believe
they are the Messiah, which is something I treasured since.

SGlau: So I presume I’m also the Messiah?

SMG: You got it. We are the most powerful people on Earth, and we should aim
to bring the end of days.

A lot of people think that the proper way to achieve world domination is to
create an [architecture that will solve the whole world’s problems and then
some](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000018.html). We’ve been
seeing quite a few of them since /Joel on Software/ wrote this article: Ruby,
Google Go, Node.js, Mozilla’s Rust, Clojure, Scala, Perl 6, etc. Some of them
have or will mature to something truly nice, or have inspired a lot of
features in other languages, but it’s hard for plain-old-single-you to compete
with them, and here is something interesting: not too many people want them.

What do people want? Chuck Norris/etc. factoids, lolcats and other captioned
images, funny cat videos, parodies of /My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic/
(♥), photos of attractive (or even not too attractive) men and women,
screencasts of games or other programs (including many open source programs),
photos of scenery, new and improved recipes for preparing food (and of course
- tasty food itself), new, old or renovated jokes, and some interesting tales
and anecdotes from your life. And naturally - programs that can will scratch
an itch - however small.

Some people told me that my solver for Freecell and other solitaire games,
simply called [Freecell Solver](http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/) is useless,
but it's not - it's just a niche program. And I received hundreds of E-mails
about it. Furthermore, given that Freecell is (or used to be) a big phenomenon
in Israel, where many boys and girls starting from the age of 18 found
themselves playing it on the [Israeli
military](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel_Defense_Forces) computers out of
boredom, then the fact that I have written a solver for it, has impressed many
people I talked with or met, including some attractive (both physically and
intellectually) young ladies, and they ended up asking me about how it was
written, and which algorithms it employed.

So Freecell Solver was one of my most successful programs, not despite being a
niche program, but because of it. Niche programs own. Not only that, but niche
everything is great. Many people whom I referred to [my
stories](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/) helped themselves to the
screenplay [Star Trek: “We, the Living
Dead”](http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/)
*because* it contained Star Trek in the name, and because there are quite a
few fans of the /Star Trek/ franchise and worlds.

The more of a niche artwork you write, the more a large subset of those who
like it, are likely to pay attention to it, try it out, and enjoy it. For more
information, see Eric Sink’s excellent and inspiring essay [“How to get people
talking about your product”](http://www.ericsink.com/articles/Buzz.html). For
example, [DuckDuckGo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DuckDuckGo) was originally
marketed as a search engine by Perl geeks, and for Perl geeks. It was a good
marketing decision because the Perl community is small, cohesive and is at a
good strategical position to influence other communities. Right now, many
people who are not Perl programmers, are using it, as well as, or even in
preference to Google, but choosing Perl was a good preliminary strategical
decision. We can expect that with the future growth of DuckDuckGo, that it
will use more performant technologies than Perl more and more, but it will
still owe some of its initial success to starting out as a Perl product.

Selina: Yep! Got my traveller’s checks, some dollars, my mobile, my passport,
some water, some snacks, some sunscreen. Not sure if all that will help with
surviving The Amber, but I can always hope.

Mephiqoleth: I COULD HAVE USED MY CONJURING SPELLS TO CONJURE THEM FOR YOU.

Selina: Well, as someone who saw enough of your demons’ lot’s shenanigans,
*and* some episodes of Sabrina, there’s no way I will trust such magically
conjured goods.

Mephiqoleth: YOU MAY BE RIGHT. MAGIC CAN BE A DOUBLE-EDGED SWORD.

BUT BACK TO BUSINESS. ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT ME TO TELEPORT YOU TO THE AMBER?

Selina: Positive. Do your worst!

Mephiqoleth: Fair enough.

[Mephiqoleth raises his hands and says in Hebrew, as the Hebrew letters (in
the modern Hebrew alphabet) appear on the highlighted floor, with a darkened
room and the Hebrew letters of the spoken message expand outward.]

sometimes greeted by “Hi, Selina!”, “What’s new?”, etc. and answers briefly.

approaches them.]

Selina: Oh, there you are. Hi Jess, hi Jon.

Jessica: Selina! I see you’ve survived History class.

Selina: Yeah, I’ll take it one lesson at a time, I guess.

Selina: So how are you two love-birds?

Jessica: Oh, this and that, discussing computers endlessly as usual.

Selina: [ Sarcastically ] Geeks!

Jessica: Heh, like you’re not a geek too.

Selina: I is!

Jessica: And we is too.

Selina: True.

Selina: This reminds me. I really should update my Mandriva system at home. I
have not in several days, now. And to think I originally had my friend Aaron
install Mandrake Linux for me, because I thought it was cool that it was
called the same as my last name.

Jessica: Heh, maybe you should become Selina Mandriva now.

Jonathan: Or Selina Mageia.

[Selina bursts out laughing.]

Selina: That sounds like a name of a vampire slayer… or a vampire.

Jonathan: Or both.

Selina: Yeah. I told you about how I was nicknamed “Puffy” and then “Buffy”
during one summer camp, right?

Jessica: Yes, many times.

Selina: Yeah, I found it amusing at the time. For a while afterwards, I
insisted that my friends call me “Buffy” until I realised it was silly, and
reverted back to “Selina”.

Jessica: Anyway, I’m off to gym.

Selina: Bye, love you.

Selina: Selina “Buffy” Mandrake. *The* Slayer. I like the sound of it.

I don’t remember whose idea it was, but we ended up enrolling Eve into the
Homecoming Queen contest. When Eve discovered she was on the nominees list,
she was a bit upset.

“Homecoming Queen? Me? Why would I ever want to be a homecoming queen?”

“Eve, we thought you could see how beautiful you are, and how much people
could like you, if they got to know you.” I answered.

“Hah! Well… oh heck, I don’t have a ready reply. But I’m going to get you guys
for this. I really will.” and she started to walk from there. “You’ll see.”

Eve showed up to the homecoming queen nominees roundup, wearing one of her
best dresses. When her turn came, she began her speech:

“Ladies and Gentlemen. I don’t know how many of you know me, but my name is
Eve Siegel. I urge you to vote for me for homecoming queen, not for your sake,
but for mine. I really need you to vote for me, because my entire future
depends on it. Seriously.”

“Take a look at my Résumé, for example. ‘Experienced in computers and
programming since 1994.’ ; ‘Experienced in Linux and UNIX technologies since
1998’ ; ‘2000-2005 - Debian Packager’, ‘2005-Present - Mandrake Packager’, and
more of this vain. Tell me, who will take a second look at this C.V. if it did
not say, ‘2005 - Elected as a homecoming queen.’?”

“Now for what I’m going to do if I’m elected. I’m going to erect a gigantic
statue of Tux the Penguin, this guy [picture showing on the screen], and also
one for Beastie the BSD Daemon, [picture showing] for good measure. I’m going
to fight against abusive behaviour toward nerds and geeks, for computer
literacy, and… for world peace. What the heck!”

“But all these philanthropical causes are secondary to my egoistical motives
of having to win this title for my own good. Thank you!”

She practically brought down the house with this speech. Even Taylor and I
could not resist a maniacal laughter. She ended up being one of the five
finalists. As the elections were on, Eve started her own campaign sloganed
“Don’t vote for Eve!” and gave away pamphlets with nothing but raves about the
other four contestants. This also increased her karma considerably.

She wore the same dress during the homecoming queen ceremony, as during the
pre-election. As the runner-ups were announced, she was given warm hugs from
all-of-them. She ended up being the first runner-up with a margin of only 5
votes to the real winner. She ended up saying she was glad she did not take
the title, but I never saw her happier than on that day.

She did not put it in her résumé.

When Eve and I got together to go shopping, we went to a clothes shop. “You
know, my newfound powers are intoxicating. Three guys hit on me at school
since the weekend, including this really cute Football player.” she said.

“Hmmm… ” I said.

“Are you ladies alright?” the shop’s clerk (Tim, a young and handsome man)
approached us.

“Hey Tim!” I said, “I don’t believe you know my friend Eve here.”

“Eve Siegel!” she said and extended her hand.

“Tim O’Brian.” he said and they shook hands. “OK, I’ll be there if you need
me…”

Eve followed him with her gaze for a few seconds, and then smiled and went
back to looking at the clothes.

“Will you stop that?” I whispered to her.

“Stop what?” she said.

“You’re totally into him.”

“So I’m lusting him a little bit, so what? ‘But I say unto you, that whosoever
looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already
in his heart.’”

“Well, girlfriend, committing adultery in your heart is perfectly harmless and
quite rewarding. And I’m not really raping anyone. I’m tenderly making love to
them.”

“Listen,” I snapped at her, “Taylor is my best friend, and I swear that if
you…”

“I’m crazy about Taylor.” she interrupted me.

“What?” I said.

She changed her pose. “I’m crazy about Taylor. Always have been. I promise I
wouldn’t do anything to hurt him.”

“You always have been crazy about Taylor? Why didn’t you tell him that?”

“Come on, have you looked at me then? I wasn’t his type. He always dated these
well-groomed girls, who had some sense not to rebel like I did. Hell, he also
dated this incredibly dumb cheerleader once.”

“Stacie wasn’t dumb!”

“I was being sarcastic! My point is that he was way out of my league.”

“Oh!” I said and tried to hug her.

“No hug!” she said. “In any case, I’ll do my best to make things work between
Taylor and I. And even if they don’t, we’ll remain good friends. The kind of
friends who go to movies together, or socialise at LUG meetings, fix dates for
each other, etc.”

“Good, I’m glad to hear that. Now where were we?”

“Picking clothes.” she said, and after a while added: “You know, we should
drop by Radio Shack and get some dolls of Tux and Beastie the BSD Daemon. I
totally dig these guys. Oh! And a nice Looney Toons poster. I’d hate to pump
money into the MPAA’s lawsuit machine, but I really like Marvin the Martian.”

“Who are you, and what have you done to Erisa?”

“Hey, the makeover was your idea, Jennifer. What have *you* done to Erisa?”
and we both laughed.

“Hi Taylor!” we said one after the other.

“Hey guys, ” he said, “what are you guys doing here?”

“Helping Erisa get ready for her date.” I said.

“I’ll get her.” Amanda said, and went up the stairs.

“Don’t you think you look a bit plain for the date?” I asked.

“Well, it’s only a movie and a pizza. Plus, there’s no way on Earth that Erisa
is going to look better than I am.”

“Holy virgin mother of god!” exclaimed Jeff. He was looking at the staircase
where Erisa stood, descending it slowly. Her jet-black hair was arranged in a
ball and a pony tail, shining from the light. Her dark purple dress made her
look especially beautiful, and complemented her body. She looked wonderful.

“So, ” she said after she reached the ground floor, shaking her body and
extending her hands, “how do I look?”

“You look… ” Taylor said, “divine!”

Erisa thought for a moment and then said: “‘Divine’s good.”

“Here, Erisa…”

“Hey, ‘Erisa’ was the old (and temporary) me. Call me ‘Eve’ now.”

“…Eve! Here - I brought you flowers.” and he handed her the flowers he had.

Eve (!) smelled them, and said, “they smell nice. Mum, can you put them in a
vase with some water?”

“Ahhmm… Eve, can we stop by my house and give me a chance to pick up some
better clothes?”

“Why?” Eve said, “we’re going to miss the movie.”

“Well, people will look at the two of us and say: ‘she is *way* out of his
league!’”

Eve approached Taylor. “Well, to quote Richard P. Feynman, ” she said as she
tied her arms around his neck “‘What do you care what other people think?’ We
both know you’re a great guy and I’m so lucky to go on a date with you.
Mwaaa…” and she kissed him on the cheek.

“Well, ” he said, “I guess we’d better get going. Bye all!”

“Bye!” we all said. Eve and Taylor left and Taylor gave us a thumb’s up as he
left, and we gave him back.

 <whatsyourname>  hey rindolf
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: hi.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: what's your name? ;-)
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: i met you a couple of times in #programming
                  years ago
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: ah, I vaguely remember it and can also
                  grep my logs.
 <whatsyourname>  what brought you to ##english channel anyway?
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: you're welcome .
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I'm here on autojoin, but often just
                  lurking.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: thing is - I cannot sleep yet today - too
                  many high thoughts.
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: I see
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: do you mind if I share these thoughts
                  with you?
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: here on the channel?
       <rindolf>  And he left.
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: i don't mind
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: OK.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I have a short essay (maybe a Google+
                  post) called "Play to lose"
 <whatsyourname>  When did you write it?
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: where I say that you can learn more from
                  a match/fight/argument/etc. that you lose than one that
                  you won.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I didn't write it yet.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: but i'd like to - sorry for being
                  unclear.
 <whatsyourname>  okay
 <whatsyourname>  please continue
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: thing is - it was believed that
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee is the best
                  combat fighter in history, and Chuck Norris is the
                  second best one.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: now at the moment Norris is losing quite
                  a few fights, but part of it is due to him being past
                  his prime and with a malfunctioning left leg.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: but my pet theory is that many of the new
                  age fighters could have beaten both Chuck Norris and
                  Bruce Lee (who has since passed away unfortunately) in
                  their prime, at least some of the time.
 <whatsyourname>  Okay
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: and it's also possible that in this day
                  and age if we take Joe and Martin who are two superb
                  mixed martial artists (MMAs) then it's possible that
                  sometimes Joe will win and sometimes Martin.
 <whatsyourname>  Yeah
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: moreover, the ancient Hebrew word for
                  fighting or warfare has other more positive connotations
                  : Bread (Lechem), soldering (Lehalchim - as in
                  electronics), etc.
 <whatsyourname>  Well, that's very interesting
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: the root Ch.R.b/bh is reserved for
                  destruction and a sword is called "Cherev".
 <whatsyourname>  Hehe
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: maybe it's similar to the greek mythology
                  conception of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena as
                  noble and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares as violent
                  and destructive.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: my point is that there are many other
                  ways to fight aside from combat.
 <whatsyourname>  okay
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: and the fighting I'm really good at is at
                  writing essays, stories, humour, etc. (which also convey
                  serious messages in hopefully amusing ways).
 <whatsyourname>  i see
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: anyway, I decided that I encourage people
                  to tell me why they think my stories sucked.
       <rindolf>  So I can improve in the future.
 <whatsyourname>  you should go about writing it
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname:
                  http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/
                  - someone told me he didn't like that, and after I asked
                  him for the specifics, gave me a detailed analysis, and
                  I realised he was right and improved it.
 <whatsyourname>  i'm glad to hear that
       <rindolf>  Part of the original problem there was that that Emma
                  Watson expressed herself in a manner that is unfit for
                  an educated and intellectual Britishwoman who, on top of
                  it, has graduated from English Literature from Brown
                  University (which is a prestigious school.).
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: Yaakov on #perl said that he forgot how
                  to speak English properly, because he doesn't know which
                  words are common and which are not.
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: what's his native language?
       <rindolf>  I have a huge problem with English vocabulary, but maybe
                  it's actually better for non-native speakers of English
                  (Which still sometimes ask me for clarification or "What
                  that words means?").
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I think it's English. He's an American
                  religious Jew.
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I'm an Israeli secular Jew.
 <whatsyourname>  rindolf: I see
       <rindolf>  whatsyourname: I think I'll just prepare a fortune
                  cookie out of this conversation and call it a day.
 <whatsyourname>  Sure
       <rindolf>  I'm too lazy to write a proper essay and people may
                  equally appreciate reading an IRC log.
      <Somelauw>  rindolf: Just looking a bit at your essay. "but we
                  decided to give you a chance anyway". Here you miss the
                  opportunity to come up with a good humorous motivation
                  to interview her.
       <rindolf>  Somelauw: heh.
       <rindolf>  Somelauw: well, I don't feel strongly about it.
       <rindolf>  Somelauw: maybe they can say that they figured out it
                  will be good publicity for their firm.

[Becky and Chankey are sitting in the library, studying together, and
listening to Cimorelli - “When I’m gone” . Faith approaches them.]

Faith: Hmm... hi kids! That doesn’t sound exactly like Anna Kendrick.

Whoa, who are all those girls?

Becky: Oh, they are Cimorelli - six sisters who sing together. They are a big
hit on YouTube.

Faith: Six sisters!

Chankey: And they also have some brothers.

Faith: Heh, God bless their mother. After my third pregnancy (to twins) I
said: “That’s it. No way, José!”.

I would think their being a big family is part of their charm.

Chankey: Yes, and the way I see it: all the power to them. See: I read 20,000
Leagues Under the Sea as a child, and I ended up memorising the English
translation and now the French original, because I liked it so much.

Anyway, Captain Nemo there, thinks he’s a nobody, which is what “Nemo” means
in Latin, but he's not. Thing is: lots of people expressed interest in him due
to his various unique qualities, and he kept thinking: “They are interested in
tangential stuff, not in the real me. They don't know the real me.”

And here's the thing: all these qualities are what make you who you are, and
you should exploit them and be yourself.

Faith: Indeed!

while some people seem to have better talent for some things from an early age
(or what you call "age"), many great artists worked hard to acquire it.
Furthermore, hard work can and should be a lot of fun, and it's important to
also "Have a life" and eat&drink well ("Wine"), enjoy the company of people of
any sex ("Women") and have clean , creative, recreational fun, however
amateuristic or lame ("Song").

I've started writing about all that in [an
essay](http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/)
on my site which I called “Putting All Cards on the Table (2013)” and now I
wish to combine it, with some newer and older insights into “Putting Many
Cards on the Table (2015)” which will likely need to be updated in upcoming
years as well.

Like the old (and wise) adage goes: “The best time to plant a tree was 100
years ago. The second best time to plant a tree is now”. What it implies in
this context is that the earlier you start honing a skill, the sooner you will
become better at it.

Anyway, what I suggest you do is go outside and socialise more: talk to people
with dogs ("Hi! Nice dog! How is he called? How old is he? What kind of dog is
it? What's *your* name? What do you do?") , interesting shirts, tattoos, etc.
Also - make sure to talk to shop clerks, shop vendors, waiters/waitresses,
barmen, baristas, etc..

One thing I learned from
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratatouille_%28film%29)
is that "Everyone can cook", or do most other stuff that was shown to be
possible. Furthermore, contrary to popular belief (action) heroism is about
bending the rules, and finding you own unique, resourceful and ingenius,
"hacky" way to do things like David used a sling to shoot goliath instead of
using a spear to fight him and most likely dying. My essay has [a
section](http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath)
about why David was an action hero and a "hacker", in a broad definition of
the word.

Another advice I can give you is to accept the fact that you're depressed and
be content. It's OK to be depressed, like this episode of Simsons illustrates:
[http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moaning_Lisa](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moaning_Lisa)
. Also, one of the the best ways to be happy is to be content with what you
have and who you are and accept and love yourself. "He who has more is not
happier than he who is content with less.".

Finally, I've recently been tweeting a lot (see my feed at
[https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies](https://twitter.com/shlomif/with_replies)
) about [Darwinian
Fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_%28biology%29) which I believe
is manifested in humans in (sexual) attractiveness, a.k.a: "hot"ness (which is
not the same as beauty and I believe is more important), and which has a very
good and positive correlation with competence a.k.a what Marx referred to as
"able" in his [“From each according to his ability, to each according to his
need”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/From_each_according_to_his_ability%2C_to_each_according_to_his_need)
slogan.

Now, this fitness/attractiveness is not the same as the so-called [Physical
fitness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness) and as I contemplated
on a tweet,
«[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candice_Swanepoel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candice_Swanepoel)
,
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Kerr](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miranda_Kerr)
,
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Watson)
or
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence)
can get more and better dates when in a cranky mood, than the buffest obscure
female body builder/"fitness" competitor on a good day.», and that's because
they are more (biologically) fit. Moreover, in British slang "fit" came to
mean a sexually desirable MOTAS regardless of how athletic he or she is.

If you still want to lose weight then I suggest following my variation on
Maimonides' advice for dieting. Namely:

1. Eat well, and eat what you feel like and want to.

2. Don't eat in haste - eat in comfort and enjoy your meal.

3. Eat according to the stomach - not according to the eye.

4. Eat until you're 75% full - not until you're 100% full (and can't eat
another bite).

5. A bit minor, but my father kept eating food along with extra bread, so
he'll feel more full, but I think it has an adversary effect.

Finally, there was [this Slashdot
feature](http://science.slashdot.org/story/09/12/06/2228210/how-men-and-women-badly-estimate-their-own-intelligence)
which claimed that most men and women claimed that their male relatives were
more intelligent than their female ones, and I believed the problem is that
men and boys tend to be more *confident* than women and girls (or used to at
least), and that implies taking more chances, being more sloppy, allowing
yourself to make mistakes, and accepting the fact that some people will
dislike you. After a while, I saw this music video by Christina Grimmie which
has the very same theme, and this pet theory of mine was reinforced:

                 Jennifer Lawrence and let me watch the sex tape. ;-)
                 Lesbian sex is hawt!
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, or or you can just do what makes you happy :P
     <misspwn_>  i'm not going to become a lesbian for convenience of
                 others sorry
  <errgnomeous>  what if eating skittles naked while sitting in a hot tub
                 and watching netflix is what makes you happy?
       <Delver>  do whatever you can get by with. whomever it is. don't be
                 too selective
     <misspwn_>  because then I’ll have to stop shaving my armpits and
                 become a vegan and read old articles from Gloria Steinem
       <Delver>  it hurts later
     <misspwn_>  yeah, you'll end up like joan rivers on life support, and
                 no one truly wants that
     <misspwn_>  mine worked
       <Delver>  there are 2 homeless couples and a single woman camping
                 near me
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: heh, so much for stigma.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I've met many really cool Lesbians.
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, :P stigma is for the birds, son
     <misspwn_>  i also have pretty awesome lesbian friends
      <rindolf>  And I think homosexuality is a spectrum.
     <misspwn_>  they aren't all super feminazi-hambeasts
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: that's nice.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: that's great.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: so you're a girl who uses the term "Feminazi"?
                 I tend to say "cynical feminism" which is less ambiguous.
      <rindolf>  I acknowledge the existence of non-cynical feminism (e.g:
                 My Little Pony).
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, for me personally it's the whole 3rd wave
                 feminist movement i cannot stand so the term feminazi
                 seems to fit the bill
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: ah, OK.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: how many waves were there?
      <rindolf>  Which wave is Buffy? I cannot remember.
     <misspwn_>  well unless it turns into 4th Reich, i believe there is
                 only 3
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, i don't think your average stereotypical 3rd
                 wave feminist truly appreciates what the previous women
                 have accomplished for them
     <misspwn_>  it's a circle jerk of men bashing
     <misspwn_>  er i should say truly does not appreciate @ rindolf
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_power -
                 apparently Buffy is 3rd wave feminism.
     <LadyTr0n>  what other circle jerk could you possibly be referring
                 to?
     <LadyTr0n>  men hating on men
     <LadyTr0n>  and masturbating
       <Delver>  actually it's good to male bash. it's one of the freedoms
                 that women earned
     <LadyTr0n>  no bueno
      <rindolf>  Xena was an awfully feminist (and unrealistic and
                 comical) heroine, but I can retrospectively say she was
                 awesome.
     <misspwn_>  Delver, possibly, but i feel some take it too far
       <Delver>  of course
      <rindolf>  Lucy Lawless who played her: 1. Also had starred in some
                 Oceanian porn films before doing Xena. 2. Cried in her
                 wedding.
     <misspwn_>  and i'm not oppressed when i make my bf a sandwich
                 either. i like to cook
       <Delver>  just like men take this silly "men’s rights" backlash
                 into dumb directions
     <misspwn_>  yep
       <Delver>  as long as we find a happy median
       <Delver>  too bad we only get one life to fuck up
     <misspwn_>  you get your all or nothing groups in all categories
       <Delver>  or maybe just as well
      <rindolf>  Lots of people couldn't imagine Xena (the character)
                 crying at her wedding.
  <errgnomeous>  actually there's an infinite amount of lives we just
                 don't realize it
     <misspwn_>  it's just a shame you have the ones who are the moldy
                 slice of bread in the package
     <misspwn_>  it just spreads
      <rindolf>  Buffy was a different matter altogether - she cried
                 sometimes.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I'm a 37 years old man who can cook only very
                 simple things like pasta - not too politically correct, I
                 know.
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, you get as much you put in
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: recently https://twitter.com/BarRefaeli tweeted
                 about the fact that she started cooking and her Tsculent
                 (with chicken!) looked yumyum.
     <misspwn_>  if you only put just the tip in, someone is going to be
                 disappointed
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: yes, my parents and sisters are excellent
                 cooks, but I lack the time and energy for cooking.
      <rindolf>  I enjoy eating food (naturally) but don't mind going to
                 eat it in a restaurant.
       <Delver>  I ate vegetable straws all evening
       <Delver>  mildly nauseated
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: on the plane back home my father and I met a
                 man who couldn't even cook pasta (which I can).
     <misspwn_>  yikes
      <rindolf>  Delver: ah , maybe eat something else.
     <misspwn_>  one thing i've never made and would like to master is
                 beef Wellington
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: he was an amazing man though, and resembled
                 both my father and me.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: ah.
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: my mother doesn't taste the food while cooking
                 it and still usually gets good results. They recently got
                 many good ideas from T.V. or the Internet, etc.
       <Delver>  LadyTr0n, keep on hangin in there
     <misspwn_>  rindolf, that's me, hasn't really failed yet except for
                 some couscous with spinach that had far too much lemon
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: ah.
     <misspwn_>  earthy lemony overload yikes
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I'm OK with couscous.
     <misspwn_>  couscous is great!
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: I prefer rice or pasta or noodles or tabulah or
                 whatever though.
       <Delver>  I need some righteous manhate songs ladies. post it!

     <misspwn_>  i've met richard stallman
      <rindolf>  misspwn_: ah, I was told St. Louis is a boring town.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: [ on IM ] Hello, Selina! How are you doing, today?

Selina: I’m fine. Trying to contribute to the Hebrew Wikipedia. These Affixes
are driving me crazy.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: Heh, עברית קשה שפה, but there are worse.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: האם את מדברת עברית? [ = “Do you speak Hebrew?” ]

Selina: Qtsath, or as new speakers will say Qetsath. Heh.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: Yes, one of the first words you have to learn to say, and
it’s already a Shibboleth.

Selina: Emeth. [ = "True." ]

BTW, are you actually Mosheh Ben-Amram (= Moses) the Hebrew prophet?

Mosheh Ben-Amram: I won’t deny that I am.

Selina: Hah!

Mosheh Ben-Amram: There are quite a few other people called “Mosheh Ben-Amram”
in the Israeli phone directory.

Selina: Yes, I can imagine that.

Actually, judging by recent happenings, learning Hebrew may be the least of my
problems.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: Anything you’d like to talk about?

Selina: No, I don’t expect you to believe me, anyway. Any more than the amount
that I’ll believe you if you told me you were actually the Jewish prophet.

Mosheh Ben-Amram: Yes, well, I have some business to tend to. Good luck with

A lecture or two ago, when Guy Keren was saying that linux would never ever be
a gaming platform i tried to point out he was wrong, and it's actually doing
OK, and everyone looked at me like i'm crazy.

>>>

Some rules of thumb I tweeted about recently:

1. If someone tells you something is impossible and you can't do it, it
probably can be done.

2. If someone tells you something will *surely* never happen, it likely can
happen.

3. If someone tells you are an idiot and are definitely wrong, then you
probably uncovered an [Elephant in the
Room](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elephant_in_the_room) and are right. Also
see [“Encourage criticism and try to get
offended”](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/).

In general, people who are sure of themselves are probably wrong, as I am not
even sure of the [Aristotlean
Logic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aristotle#Logic) which got us incredibly
far.

Back when I was in the 9th grade, during a Physics lesson, one of my
classmates complained to the teacher that something we were learning was too
hard. So my teacher asked her “Do you see people with picket baskets outside?”
and she answered no. And then he said “Well, then you should know that life is
no picnic!”.

           <bkeys>  I hate it but there is no better option
           <bkeys>  yourself?
         <rindolf>  bkeys: I fixed Freecell Solver on ARM linux.
         <rindolf>  bkeys: turns out "char"s in C are unsigned there by
                    default.
           <bkeys>  I thought this was always the case
         <rindolf>  bkeys: they are signed on x86
           <bkeys>  I did not know this
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Protip: uint8_t and int8_t exist. Use them. :P
         <rindolf>  bkeys: ah.
           <bkeys>  I almost never use chars directly
         <rindolf>  ExpiredPopsicle: I know
           <bkeys>  Most of the time C++ data structures are good enough
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Sign extending a char to an int can ruin your day.
           <bkeys>  Then ints and floats
       <BlackMoon>  rindolf: so you actually have to type signed char? :)
       <BlackMoon>  weird.
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Or you could just use int8_t.
       <BlackMoon>  neverah
         <rindolf>  BlackMoon: yes
       <BlackMoon>  you can take my poorly defined types from my cold,
                    dead, typedefed hands
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  pfft
         <rindolf>  BlackMoon: or use the -fsigned-char compiler flag
       <BlackMoon>  'build procedure: use more obscure flags'

       <BlackMoon>  activate emergency optimizations!
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  Also I accidentally made the optimizer sentient. We're
                    all doomed.
       <BlackMoon>  nah we’re fine just so long as.. oh, you showed it
                    some of your source code too? Well no wonder it wants
                    to end all human life
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  You know how the optimizer figures out how some code
                    is unneeded and just deletes it?
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  It did that with humans.
       <BlackMoon>  or stuffed us all into a lib somewhere, never to be
                    linked with again
 <ExpiredPopsicle>  We have been simplified down to a 32-bit constant:

         <Type-21>  >DEFINATELY
       <BlackMoon>  I hope the compilers come for you first Type-21
         <Type-21>  i'm already lost
         <Type-21>  the compilers are flowing through me
       <BlackMoon>  resistance is futile, you will be compil error on line

        <BlackFox>  I'm defiantly a void

 <rindolf>  Hi all
 <rindolf>  Sup?
     <Zuu>  Hi rindolf and Thymo :>
     <Zuu>  Merry weekend :>
 <rindolf>  Zuu: hi
     <Zuu>  How goes it?
 <rindolf>  Zuu: fine - working on cpan modules
   <Thymo>  Hey.
 <rindolf>  Zuu: perls before swine
   <Thymo>  Is GitHub up for you guys?
 <rindolf>  Thymo: it was a while ago
     <Zuu>  rindolf, do you happen to know if there’s some sort of perl to
            C transformer tool?
     <Zuu>  there's this EXIF tool written in perl, and it's just nuts
            that its not in C :P
 <rindolf>  Zuu: you can embed Perl code in C code
     <Zuu>  of course, if i wanted to have the entire interpreter on board
     <Zuu>  anyway, i take it as a "no, i don’t know of such a thing" :)
   <Thymo>  status.github.com
   <Thymo>  They just got a major outage.
     <Zuu>  ouch
   <Thymo>  Server availability just dropped to 0%.
     <Zuu>  maybe the student worker accidentally altered the DNS records
            :P
   <Thymo>  It had major outages yesterday.
     <Zuu>  Maybe they have two student workers :P
     <Zuu>  Or DoS...
   <Thymo>  The servers are still up. They're serving a 503 page.
     <Zuu>  or government attack :O
     <Zuu>  no, wait! The aliens have landed!
 <rindolf>  Zuu: heh
     <Zuu>  or maybe little bobby 0; DROP TABLES; -- have visited
   <Thymo>  SSH is still up.
   <Thymo>  But hangs as soon as it connects.
         *  Zuu starts playing the intro theme for X-Files
     <Zuu>  Thymo, We've got to solve this mystery
   <Thymo>  Let's ping -f them to see when they'll get back up. :p
     <Zuu>  i will help by making fun of things :>
     <Zuu>  to make sure we're doing a reliable ping, i think we need to
            ping it from several places
     <Zuu>  say... from a large scale botnet
 <rindolf>  Zuu: heh
     <Zuu>  you know... to see if it has come up yet :P
 <rindolf>  Zuu: you've been making me laugh now

       <rindolf>  foddo: it's one of my most coveted life achievements
       <rindolf>  foddo: why not?
         <foddo>  i mean you'll have to up your horrible game somewhat
                  dramatically
       <rindolf>  foddo: so I'm not as horrible as humanly possible?
                  That's quite an insult

   <rindolf>  TimToady: BTW, is the word "creator" in English reserved to
              divine creation (like Hebrew "boré") or can it be a more
              mundane one ("yotzer")?
 <geekosaur>  english has only the one
   <rindolf>  geekosaur: yes
 <geekosaur>  to the extent that there's a difference, "create" implies
              something new, "make" means following someone else's
              pattern. but not everyone uses them that way; it's a much
              looser distinction than in Hebrew
   <rindolf>  geekosaur: well, there is
              https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Creator
 <geekosaur>  yes, it varies. there's religious groups that can get snippy
              at times. they don't run the show
   <rindolf>  geekosaur: in Hebrew we have `assah for "make"
   <rindolf>  geekosaur: thanks! Seems like the FSF are being paranoid in
              this regard
 <geekosaur>  some groups are. "creator" was a perfectly good word until
              *recently* certain pseudo"Christian" groups decided to throw
              their weight around
   <rindolf>  geekosaur: ah

  <rindolf>  PSvils: hi
  <rindolf>  PSvils: node.js is dead ;)
   <PSvils>  purrhaps
   <PSvils>  I don't like node.js much, Elixir + Phoenix is the way to go.
  <rindolf>  PSvils: ah
   <PSvils>  or python depending on the tech.
   <PSvils>  imo
  <rindolf>  PSvils: they are dead too
 <brainzap>  what abomination is Elixir
  <rindolf>  everything is dead
  <rindolf>  we were born to die
   <PSvils>  brainzap: it's a language for the Erlang VM
   <PSvils>  super duper fast, flies way faster than node.js does.
 <jprajzne>  PSvils: what's the license for erlangvm?
   <PSvils>  rindolf: Python is goin' good, 3.7 release and all
   <PSvils>  jprajzne: haven't checked, shouldn't be anything that bans
             widespread use.
  <rindolf>  PSvils: everything is dead

   <PSvils>  depends on your definition of alive

   <pulse>  problem isn't when you're writing the code

   <pulse>  problem is when you look at your 5 year old code without

            that in 5 years time i'll understand the context around

[Dictionaries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associative_array) are so
convenient to use in Python/Perl/etc. that people use them there even when
they do not really need to. On the other hand, they are so clunky in C, that
people do not use them there even when they need to.

 <rindolf>  fijal: i've ran it 100 times now - same results - as expected
   <fijal>  rindolf: what's "same result" anyway?
   <fijal>  I meant specifically 100 times in the same process and ignore
            the first few (warmup)
 <rindolf>  fijal: ah
 <rindolf>  fijal: i ran it from the shell
   <fijal>  warmup has much higher variability
   <fijal>  yeah that does nothing - you are measuring essentially the

 <rindolf>  joking aside - i really like pypy - so thanks all

 <rindolf>  I had the craziest idea
   <paddy>  sell all computers?
 <rindolf>  I'm going to announce that if and when I ever accumulate at
            least 10 million USD / 10 million EUR / or 10 million ILS -
            whatever fiat coin is worth more at the point in my PayPal
            account I'll make the entire individual cultural works
            residing at my site (at present) CC-by except for those that I
            consider private / personal or those that were not original
            text and copied from elsewhere. I may not be as rich as J. K.

 <rindolf>  she donated most of her > 1,000,000,000 USD to charity - good
            for her) but with good marketing I may be settled for life.
            And I'll set all my current (not future ones naturally)
            children free and enjoy the rip offs, parodies, YouTube
            productions and maybe even ARR Hollywood films with a credit

 <rindolf>  btw my text here is CC-by-nc-sa for now
 <rindolf>  bheron: maybe twit https://twitter.com/Taylorswift13 - I think
            she is rich and she probably has a smart phone or more and I
            like many of her songs so she may be interested
 <rindolf>  don't know how much taxes I'll have to pay
 <rindolf>  I think Israel is not as bad as Britain was when
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxman was written
 <rindolf>  nice song btw
  <bheron>  rindolf: Probably worse.
 <rindolf>  I like the Beatles too
 <rindolf>  bheron: what? no!
 <rindolf>  bheron: anyway I'll pay all the taxes from however I got just
            to stay on the safe side
 <rindolf>  don't want any trouble
  <bheron>  rindolf: you forgot that Taylor Swift shares her last name
            with a cockamamie language produced by apple for people who
            are too fucking stupid to comprehend Objective-C. ;)
 <rindolf>  health >>> money
  <bheron>  I mean Objective-C is verbose and self documenting yet many
            people (who have the nerve to call themselves real
            programmers) can't handle it. ;)
  <bheron>  (hehe)
 <rindolf>  bheron: great - ad hominem
  <bheron>  No...l
 <rindolf>  bheron: maybe she'll sue apple for trademark damages
 <rindolf>  and win
  <bheron>  I hope so.
 <rindolf>  bheron: ask her
  <bheron>  you know... the swift guys wrote me about when GNUstep will
            support swift...
  <bheron>  I told them "Once your language syntax and structure stops
            changing radically every release, we will support it..."
  <bheron>  it hasn't freaking stopped yet. :)
  <bheron>  I once used it on a project for AMGEN.
  <bheron>  I had to literally rewrite the application EVERY TIME THEY
            RELEASED an update.
  <bheron>  It's actually not terribly hard to make it happen... there is
            a bit of code in the swift open source code which would allow
            it to happen.... it would be, maybe, about 2 weeks of work.
  <bheron>  rindolf: and you're right, it is an "ad hominem" attack with
            respect to what I said about certain programmers and Objective
            C... but the way I see it some people don't know assembly...
            is it the fault of the language or are they simply too dim to
            get it?
  <bheron>  (most likely the latter)
 <rindolf>  bheron: you need to charge more
  <bheron>  for?
 <rindolf>  bheron: if it's swift pay me 100,000 USD / year
  <bheron>  Oh… well for that job with AMGEN I charged $85 USD/hour.
 <rindolf>  bheron: peanuts
  <bheron>  which works out to about, estimating... 144,000?
 <rindolf>  bheron: aren't you living in .us?
  <bheron>  Yes
  <bheron>  That's a decent living.
  <bheron>  better than decent.
 <rindolf>  you can charge 300 USD / hour for swift
  <bheron>  Hah... I have never met a developer who made that much per
            hour in my life.
  <bheron>  rindolf: have you ever contracted in the US?
 <rindolf>  bheron: prices send signals -
            https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/joel-on-software.html#joel-camels-rubber-duckies-11
 <rindolf>  bheron: I'm sure there are
 <rindolf>  bheron: Bill Gates won't get out of bed for 300 USD/hour
 <rindolf>  as an example
  <bheron>  https://www.google.com/search?q=average+per+hour+income+of+developers&oq=average+per+hour+income+of+developers&aqs=chrome..69i57j33.9671j1j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8
 <rindolf>  bheron: think big
  <bheron>  Heh.
  <bheron>  Think myself out of every contract I could get. ;)
  <bheron>  the only way I'll make that is if I make my own apps... which
            I am trying to do.
  <bheron>  But you are correct on one thing... I need to think bigger.
  <bheron>  Because this contracting crap just isn't doing it.
 <rindolf>  bheron: in the book the princess bride a sword craftsman whose
            secret better craftsman was killed by the 6 fingered man
            charged more and more for his now pretty bad results and the
            more he charged the greater the demand was
 <rindolf>  bheron: have you read my link?
  <bheron>  Yes.
 <rindolf>  I'm pretty sure Taylor Swift's time is worth more than 300
            USD/hour
  <bheron>  It doesn't justify charging 185% over the national average
            when I'm already on the top end of the bell curve.
  <bheron>  That's called "Pricing yourself out of a job"
  <bheron>  I get what you're saying, I simply disagree.
 <rindolf>  if you offer her 900 USD for a three hour concert she won't
            bother replying
  <bheron>  I've known developers who charged 100 per hour.... when the
            company needed to downsize, those guys were the first to go.
 <rindolf>  bheron: ah
 <rindolf>  bheron: why do you need donations anyway?
  <bheron>  The lesson is... keep your prices reasonable. A little
            painful, but not too hard to swallow. :)
     <jmd>  $100 per hour is not a over the average these days.
  <bheron>  rindolf: Joking. :) I don't. I have enough right now.
  <bheron>  jmd: read the link I posted... it is slightly above average.
  <bheron>  The AMGEN job was years ago... I won't say how much I'm
            pulling in now.
 <rindolf>  well, unless she'll really identify with your cause
     <jmd>  My company charges between 250 - 400 (but I don't get to see
            nearly that much)
  <bheron>  I wasn't the one who mentioned Taylor Swift. ;)
     <jmd>  bheron: That's something to do with infinite series expansion
            isn't it?
  <bheron>  jmd: What are you referring to?
  <bheron>  AMGEN?
 <rindolf>  bheron: once in bay watch the fictional head life guard called
            Jenny McCarthy the famous MTV video jockey and said "Jenny
            McCarthy? Hi, it's Mitch Buchannon"
  <bheron>  AMGEN = Applied Molecular GENetics. They are a medical
            biotechnology company. They make medicines derived from
            genetically modified bacteria which produce certain
            proteins... Things like Enbrel or other biologically based
            things.
  <bheron>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amgen
 <rindolf>  so we joked "Bill Clinton? Hi, it's Shlomi Fish you know me,
            right?"
  <bheron>  LOL
 <rindolf>  bheron:

 <rindolf>  bheron: but Linus Torvalds is believed to make 20 million USD
            a year
  <bheron>  rindolf: I think you need to listen to a lot of the arguments
            you're making yourself... I would like to know....
  <bheron>  WHAT IS YOUR POINT?
  <bheron>  That I should charge some outrageous amount of money?
  <bheron>  That I'm undervaluing my work in some way... what are you
            trying to prove?
  <bheron>  So far you've hit me with several RIDICULOUS things... get to
            the point. :)
 <rindolf>  bheron: one day people will say "I don't remember who the
            prime minister of Israel is. It's not like he has 300 million
            r followers like bheron does..."
  <bheron>  LOL
 <rindolf>  bheron: I'm being motivational.
  <bheron>  No.
 <rindolf>  but time to write the blog post and try to get it on internet
            news sites
 <rindolf>  do or do not there is no try - Yoda
  <bheron>  You're being *ridiculous*... first off, you've likely never
            ever lived here in the US... so you have second hand
            experience about the financial or economic situation at
            best... and second you're giving these weird off the wall
            examples based on celebrities or people (like Linus) who were
            in the right place at the right time.
  <bheron>  I would have LOVED if my sophomore project in college turned
            into the UNIX that took over the world. :)
  <bheron>  Right place...
  <bheron>  right tie.
  <bheron>  *time
  <bheron>  Linus is NOT particularly talented.
  <bheron>  Just good at being something of an asshole.
  <bheron>  Linux is a Monolithic, poorly architected implementation of
            UNIX... to quote Ken Thomson, "Those who do not know UNIX are
            doomed to reimplement it... poorly"
 <rindolf>  bheron: https://twitter.com/GeorgeLucasILM - only 22.4 k

            one r account surpassing president Obama -
            https://twitter.com/katyperry
  <bheron>  Just like GCC is a crappy compiler... it needs to learn
            lessons from clang... did you know that gcc explicitly didn't
            break out things like the parser and other functionality which
            would have been better put into libraries so that other
            programs could use them because RMS was that "it would make it
            too easy for other apps which are proprietary to use
            functionality without giving back to the compiler" (I'm
            paraphrasing).
  <bheron>  .. I know this because that answer was given to me when I was
            trying to build a parser for C header files for a project a
            while back. (it was for Gorm to discover objects which could
            be used as target/action candidates)
  <bheron>  I don't care. :)

 <rindolf>  bheron: I'm following https://twitter.com/jk_rowling/ and she
            seems to hate president trump
 <rindolf>  bheron: of course I think many of his tweets are either good
            or so bad they are good
  <bheron>  rindolf: She hates him for a good reason...
  <bheron>  he's a fucking moron.
  <bheron>  I hate him more than most.
  <bheron>  Why people in this country put such an idiot in office I will
            never fathom.
  <bheron>  People often said... "Well, he's not a politician". To which I
            responded... "then let your next colonoscopy be performed by a
            plumber"
 <rindolf>  bheron:we are getting out of gnu land
  <bheron>  We are.
  <bheron>  To get us back...
  <bheron>  GCC needs a kick in the ass.
 <rindolf>  bheron: you should run for president when you get 300 million
            Twitter followers
  <bheron>  LOL
  <bheron>  I would never survive.
  <bheron>  Too many dark things in my past. ;)
 <rindolf>  bheron: then become the next pope
 <rindolf>  bheron: see

  <bheron>  rindolf: I'm an atheist.
  <bheron>  Me becoming pope would be a true miracle. ;)
  <bheron>  rindolf: well... strictly speaking I'm an "agnostic" in the
            same way Richard Dawkins is... see his discussion about

Q2: OK, cool. We’ll let you kids do last minute arrangements and we’ll meet
here in 45 minutes. Meanwhile I’ll have a drink.

Q: I could use one too. Quark, how much would that be?

Quark: Two drinks would be two strips of gold-pressed Latinum.

However, Mr. Q., I recall you saying you could provide me with 1 million bars
of gold-pressed Latinum.

Q: That’s nothing, Mr. Quark. I can conjure a ball made out of gold-pressed
Latinum the size of a red giant. Of course, it will quickly implode into a
nasty black hole. Nothing we can’t handle of course, but still.

[Cut to Quark - he is speechless and looks astonished.]

Q: But two strips should be enough - there you go.

   <rindolf>  refactoring and optimising code seem like bottomless pits
              (or evertop mountains?)
 <warweasle>  rindolf: I found a similar problem with retopologizing
              meshes.
   <rindolf>  warweasle: with respect to refactoring?
 <warweasle>  Although I deal with lower poly stuff so it's not nearly as
              bad as people who use the subsurf modifier all the time.
 <warweasle>  rindolf: Very similar. You can just keep making it "better"
              when the original crappy mesh was good "enough".
   <rindolf>  warweasle: ah
 <warweasle>  rindolf: It really kills me because I do both modeling AND
              code.
 <warweasle>  If I looked, I could probably find a better paying job doing
              gamedev...but I enjoy doing next to nothing.
   <rindolf>  warweasle: I recently ran into some cases where I spent many
              hours trying to fix functional defects, and then converted
              to a more elegant design, which ended up fixing the bugs
              later.
 <warweasle>  rindolf: Then that's the good kind of refactoring. But I go
              too far sometimes. I just keep trying to make it better
              because it's not "perfect".

              fix it in place.

    <k_sze>  You know how, for numbers expressed in base 10, there is a
             way to check whether an integer is divisible by 3 or 9 by
             recursively summing the digits? Is there a pattern to this
             trick that extends to other bases? Are there special
             requirements for this kind of trick to hold for a certain
             base?
  <rindolf>  k_sze: i think it is (b-1)
  <rindolf>  k_sze: you can also use a
             https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine
  <rindolf>  k_sze: which works for any number base and modulo
    <int-e>  rindolf: right, 10_b = 1_b (mod b-1)
    <k_sze>  rindolf, 3 is not b-1 for base 10, so why does it hold?
    <int-e>  k_sze: it also works for divisors of b-1.
    <int-e>  3 | 9.
  <rindolf>  k_sze: because 9 is divisible by 3
    <k_sze>  interesting. So for base 16, I could check the divisibility
             of 15, 3, and 5 using this trick?
    <int-e>  Yes.
    <int-e>  And 1, but that's silly.
          *  rindolf divides himself by 1 and gets a remainder of 0 ;)
          *  k_sze divides himself by 1 and get NaN.
  <rindolf>  k_sze: heh
          *  rindolf divides k_sze 's mum by 1 and gets +\inf
     <mawk>  k_sze: you can find other tricks by just playing with the
             numbers in the relevant base
     <mawk>  like divisibility by 11 in base 10, for abcd you do d-c+b-a
  <rindolf>  mawk: in the general case one can generate an FSM for any
             given number base and modulo
     <mawk>  yes I'm sure
    <int-e>  or a regular expression
    <int-e>  which is a terrible idea ;)
  <rindolf>  int-e: heh
    <int-e>  (The FSM for divisibility by d will have up to d states
             (sometimes you can get away with fewer, notably for divisors
             of the base)... but regular expressions based on DFAs tend to
             be large.)
  <rindolf>  int-e: i see
    <int-e>  rindolf: It's not stopping people from doing that though:
             https://github.com/olligobber/DivisibilityRegex
    <int-e>  And I tried it for divisibility by 7 once myself (with
             computer help, of course) and ended up with 10789 characters,
             plus 4 for an initial '^(' and a final ')$'.
     <mawk>  ugly
     <mawk>  ...fedcba = a + 3b + 2c - d - 3e - 2f + ...
     <mawk>  like this ?
  <rindolf>  int-e: oooh, Haskell
     <mawk>  or is there something smarter
    <int-e>  rindolf: http://paste.debian.net/1161958/ is my regex :P
    <int-e>  sheer beauty ;)
     <mawk>  I mean mod 7 of course
    <int-e>  mawk: The usual rule for this is to split the number into
             groups of 3, and alternatingly add and subtract them.
     <mawk>  but with the coefficients I've put right
     <mawk>  or did I make a mistake
    <int-e>  mawk: they're right
     <mawk>  ah good
    <int-e>  mawk: but hard to remember, I guess.
     <mawk>  yeah nobody needs divisibility by 7 anyway
     <mawk>  7 is not a pretty number
    <int-e>  cba - fed + ihg - lkj ... is easier to remember. And it also
             works for 11 and 13.
    <int-e>  (7*11*13 = 1001)
 <nejimban>  write N = 10*a + b, then N is divisible by 7 if and only if b
             - 2a is divisible by 7
     <mawk>  ah yes
     <mawk>  b-4a you mean ?
    <int-e>  Nobody really cares because we have calculators and computers
             and pocket-sized distraction rectangles.
     <mawk>  lol

 <oft_gegong>  YOU GUYS I NEED HELP. You see, it was a long time ago.
               There was a problem. And it needed solving. So in other

     <rindolf>  Hi all! I noticed many Hollywood marriages and other
                relationships have been stable ever since
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar (♥!)
                was interviewed on "why my hollywood marriage works?". I'm
                not against divorces / breakups, but I want couples to be
                happy even if I'm attracted to their female partner (and
                frankly I'm attracted to a metric ton of celebs, friends,
                and fictional characters - 😊)
     <rindolf>  Also someone here wondered why
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna hasn't starred in a
                film for years now and wondered if "she forgot how to
                act". Well, I doubt that you can forget that (if that's a
                thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERy-99vXxnM ;
                https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence never took
                acting lessons and won the oscar at age 22), I just think
                hollywood producers are scared shitless of her:
                https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/
                .
     <rindolf>  there is
                https://www.peppercarrot.com/en/article465/episode-32-the-battlefield
                too (also see the Midrash in the blog comments.)
 <hemkunskapz>  there's probably too few movies and too many actors
 <hemkunskapz>  when you're "in", you bring marketing to the movie
 <hemkunskapz>  showbiz...
 <hemkunskapz>  some producers seem to cast a selected group though
 <hemkunskapz>  continuously
     <rindolf>  hemkunskapz: many positively "hot"/attractive actors are
                unhirable:
                https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=why+hollywood+can%27t+cast
 <hemkunskapz>  yea some acting skills are probably needed
 <hemkunskapz>  otherwise it's cameos
 <hemkunskapz>  but a lot of movies have bad acting too :)
     <rindolf>  hemkunskapz: BTW: if this was a real film (after some
                possible revamp) -
                https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/
                - i bet thousands of "geeks" would love to see it. ok, i
                either need to rework the screenplay into the blessed
                hollywood format or some director needs to take the effort
                to clear their prejudice and read it as it is:
                http://paulgraham.com/gba.html (the word "hacker"). being
                a hero implies "hacking" as the ages old "David vs.
                Goliath" myth indicates:
                https://github.com/shlomif/missile-vs-melee-take-three
     <rindolf>  hemkunskapz: when i was in the psychiatric ward, a fellow
                patient (who seemed fairly sane and rational and informed)
                told me there is a genuine shortage of 'original'
                screenplays in .il. But even my "humanity" screenplay (
                https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/ - cc-by-sa )
                is based on the Jewish Bible and history lessons. Now
                imagine how films will flourish if they allowed fanfics
                and crossovers of proprietary franchises
     <rindolf>  hemkunskapz: re acting skills, sharon stone (
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharon_Stone ) acted fairly
                badly in many of her earlier films, but they were still
                successful (and i enjoyed
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quick_and_the_Dead_(1995_film)
                immensely) and i find the bad acting in last action hero'
                s hamlet scene and most of Mel Brooks' films a feature -
                not a bug
     <rindolf>  For the record:
                https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Eont_yEGZs
 <hemkunskapz>  rindolf: i've heard that too, shortage of screenplays
 <hemkunskapz>  hence remakes etc
 <hemkunskapz>  it may even be hard to find any old book that hasn't been
                adapted
 <hemkunskapz>  crossovers is a matter of copyrights i believe
 <hemkunskapz>  if that can be negotiated, no problem
     <rindolf>  hemkunskapz: yes
     <rindolf>  hemkunskapz: there was
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_vs._Predator_%28film%29
     <rindolf>  hemkunskapz: i released all of my franchises under cc-by:
                https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/copyrights/#characters_concepts_plots_and_worlds
                - but it's a drop in the ocean
     <rindolf>  and you often need to get clearance for parent franchises
     <rindolf>  hemkunskapz: here i broke the unwritten rule of doing star
                trek+starwars crossovers:
                https://github.com/shlomif/missile-vs-melee-take-three -
                it gave me an idea for a franchise crossing star wars Ep.
                I, Star Trek TNG/DS9, and current real-world/online life
                with Tiffany Alvord as
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala ; My
                Little Pony's Fluttershy as her internal thought process ;
                and the
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wayne%27s_World_(film) duo
                as the plot commentors and manipulators. I never said I
                was sane. (and normal people aren't fun)
     <rindolf>  I think I'm going to try
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Man_(web_series) next -
                giving it 3 episodes. I think stars/creators stardom and
                fandom are self-sustaining and invigorating.

You can never truly appreciate Hamlet until you've read it in the original
Klingon.

But all the mightiest Klingon warriors have watched [The Lion
King](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion_King) instead (or in addition),
possibly with Klingon subtitles.

( *Caveat Emptor:* I am a [straight and non-trans
male](https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/guy_or_girl.xhtml), so I may not
know what I am talking about. Here be dragons. )

Most men do not spend a lot of time and money on beauty products, even though
[they often have their share of frustrations with their
hair](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-men-about-problems-with-their-hair),
and they look fine. As evidence, several heterosexual women who looked at
[some of the photos people took of me](https://www.shlomifish.org/images/)
(see the ones whose filenames start with "shlomif") told me I looked handsome.

Moreover, most underage girls look cute, lovely, and beautiful, despite not
using makeup.

The [Scroll of Esther](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther) testifies
that in the time of the Persian empire (circa 470 BC), [a woman's makeup
process took 12
months](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Esther#Text_and_translations),
and these fictional women were blown out of the water by Hadassah (who became
queen Esther), who was simply confident, [was being
herself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FktDDKNrWjk) and doing it in [her own
(imperfect and thus perfect)
way](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/make-your-own-kind-of-music.xhtml).

So I suspect most beauty products are the [stone
soup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone_Soup) (or placebo) effect for women:
they instil confidence, but then can be avoided altogether for an even better,
more natural, and more beautiful look.

In my favourite
[sketch](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=mighty-boosh--ape-of-death)
of the British comedy troupe [The Mighty
Boosh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mighty_Boosh) the Ape of Death (a
male) has suffered from hair problems even as a child, and then after six
minutes of treatment says "Look at me. I'm so confident… and feel strong and
supersexy!".

In the [videoclip for "Nothing Compares 2
U"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-EF60neguk), the female singer Sinead
O'Connor looks great bald. Moreover, the bald actor [Patrick
Stewart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Stewart) became a sex symbol,
and a role model, playing the also bald [Captain Jean-Luc
Picard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard) in the iconic
television series [Star Trek: The Next
Generation](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation).

As of January 2021, the canonical "Alpha Female" (think [Sarah
Bernhardt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt) or [Marilyn
Monroe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marilyn_Monroe)) appears to be [Emma
Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Watson), who happens to be short
and not busty. Some people will always be unhappy with how you look or just
tease you for it (see the old tale ["The miller, his son and the
donkey"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_miller%2C_his_son_and_the_donkey)
and the song ["Keep on Singin' My Song" by Christina
Aguilera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=omyAL5HrUGo)); the important thing
is to realise that you are awesome, and can be confident and competent and
beautiful, and even take your "faults" to your advantage.

(If you feel that what enough, or even just one, people complain about has
merit [you can try changing your
strategy](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=linus-not-always-change-my-mind),
but the "media", including web 2.0 social media commentators, will always
generate a lot of [white noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise),
and I admit I may have erred on that too.)

*Update (February 2022):* I now think that makeup which deliberately looks
unnatural may be useful as an icebreaker, not unlike captioned or themed
T-shirts, dogs, or jewellery:

1. Lovely couple at an Anime con

2. Emma Stone in “Cruella (2021)”

            a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort
            the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone,
            solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program

            becomes "Master Darth Yoda" or "just plain 'Yoda'"
 <hmw[at]>  I'd say, it depends on the situation, who is currently
            leading. Everyone _should_ be a potential leader and also
            capable of following
   <pulse>  i disagree though
   <pulse>  did you ever try fixing a car
   <pulse>  it's really hard
 <hmw[at]>  So what.

   <pulse>  it's not safe if you don't know what you're doing either
   <pulse>  i once tried to fix brakes on my bicycle

   <pulse>  and they malfunctioned mid downhill

 <hmw[at]>  I get you :)
   <pulse>  i'd rather trust specialized professionals
 <hmw[at]>  I would rather have someone with experience fix my car,
            obviously
 <rindolf>  hmw[at]: I disagree with Heinlein that you should know
            everything. But I agree that one shouldn't over-specialise, be
            wilfully stupid, incompetent, or non-confident

I suspect the media coverage of the violence in Syria to be skewed. I think
most of Syria is peaceful most of the time and that both the Syrian government
forces and ISIL are harmless if not benevolent. I hope and expect Damascus to
remain the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world, and to feel as
Shalom-ful as Tel Aviv or Beirut. Israel, the Hizbullah, the Syrian
government, or ISIL will accept money donations, but will gladly pay
volunteers to do more than just be web/social media bloggers (often parody
ones).

Same for most other causes.

I wish to [plant trees somewhere in
Europe](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/Queen-Padme-Tales--Planting-Trees.html)
with some old or new online friends. We may not stop global warming, but we
can at least try and have fun and bring love and joy and inspiration to
ourselves and others.

[Com'on People](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjT1q7f5ysA).

Note that as opposed to secret do-gooders and in accordance with [Jeremiah
9:22-9:23](https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16006/jewish/Chapter-9.htm),
I will be full internet attention whoring (but honest and non-pushy) about my
contributions: both given - and received. Yesterday I went outside, and said
"Shavua tov", "bon appetit", and "have an easy curfew" to friendly-looking
strangers. I hope this will encourage others to dedicate time, energy - and
[gain it in
spades](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Michelle_Gellar&oldid=997890126#Charitable_activities).

The next revolution starts in us. Be a hero. Be a messiah. 😉

With all due respect to #COVID, putting people (especially old) in detainment
makes them psychologically and biologically worse and worse. A study once
concluded that exposing mice to radiation harmed their immunity system.
However, my father (a biologist) told me that a different study found that
just moving a mouse through corridors in a building had the same bad effect on
their immunity system even without exposing to radiation, due to causing
stress and fright. Humans wish to go outside and do what they want ( "as you
wish" / "make it so" / "carpe diem" ): [Saladin
Style](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/) .

NOTE: here is [a
citation](https://www.simplypsychology.org/stress-immune.html#:~:text=When%20we're%20stressed%2C%20the,lowers%20the%20number%20of%20lymphocytes)
that my father found about the effect of stress on the immune system. I recall
reading that [Maimonides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides) noted that
a person's optimism influenced his recovery, and there may likely have been
earlier sources).

The months i spent in the closed psychiatric ward for being "bipolar" and
unable to leave were worse than my 6.5 years in the technion, and they would
be even worse if I weren't so resourceful: [Highway to

  <Hail_Satan>  The Trumpism cancer threatening fascism on America shows
                no signs of remission
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: i'm hopeful
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: and r censoring @realDonaldTrump was fascistic
                too
  <Hail_Satan>  64% say they'd form a new party if he left
  <Hail_Satan>  no, it was not fascistic. You, a Jew of all people, need
                to learn what "fascism" is about
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: it is anti free speech
  <Hail_Satan>  No it is not
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: it is
  <Hail_Satan>  Why can't I barge in on your house and yell at you about
                how Jews are inferior? Why is that something you support?
        <c705>  you don't have a right to free speech on r
        <c705>  it's their platform, they have a right to do whatever they
                want with it
  <Hail_Satan>  rindolf's on the spectrum
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: c705 :
                https://www.reddit.com/r/Twitter/comments/kgmrxx/tip_make_sure_you_enter_your_real_birth_year_eg/
  <Hail_Satan>  he needs edge case examples, because regular explanations
                don't work
        <c705>  great way to lose the argument before it even began
        <c705>  rindolf: i'm not clicking that
     <rindolf>  c705: can you form your own r? get real
  <Hail_Satan>  yes, you have to be at least 13 years old to use r lol
        <c705>  rindolf: yes, actually you can
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: and i am 42
  <Hail_Satan>  that's nice
        <c705>  see Parler, and whatever other garbage is out there
  <Hail_Satan>  I like some fish
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: and Samantha Smith was 10 y.o. when she sent
                the letter
  <Hail_Satan>  that doesn't make any sense, rindolf
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: why doesn't it?
                https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith - read about
                her
  <Hail_Satan>  this is your argument why r banning trump is fascist? lol
  <Hail_Satan>  "We Jewish autists endorse genocide as a form of speech,
                which must be respected"
  <Hail_Satan>  lick boot harder
  <Hail_Satan>  in fact, if these are your true beliefs, I'm fine with the
                Nazis genociding your bloodline.
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: no, these are two different issues
  <Hail_Satan>  Once sycophants like you are gone, we can finally get to
                the real work of ending the fascists
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan: i think "the truths are out there"
     <rindolf>  Hail_Satan:

        <mawk>  what do you have against fascists Hail_Satan ?
  <Hail_Satan>  Nothing. Kill the Jews, mawk. Start with rindolf.

        <mawk>  I'm a peaceful fascist
     <rindolf>  not everything trump said on Twitter was bad, and many
                people replied to him or retweeted him
  <Hail_Satan>  I'm going to ignore rindolf now
  <Hail_Satan>  The last thing I need is Israeli pro-trump spam in my life
  <Hail_Satan>  Fuck off n die
        <mawk>  lol
     <rindolf>  heh.

I at ~ 2006 "I'd rather be doing hot models than doing code".

I at ~2021 "I'm not just doing it for money. I'm doing it for doing hot
youtubers!" . I think most attractive [members of the appropriate sex
(MOTAS)](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/MOTAS.html) are polymath, geeky and
hacker (= action hero) entertainers/educators/amateur philosophers, anyway.

(Also: your kilometrage may vary, but I need only one attractive significant
other at a time. [Or
fewer](http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/99_Problems/). )

themselves [equally
good](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Dead_Putting_Society) and go:

1. Grab a few drinks or snacks together.

2. Hit on a couple of men.

3. Hit these men.

4. Make out with these men.

5. Make love to these men.

6. Make love to each other…😉.

7. Whatever floats their boat!

    <rindolf>  Prestige: it's funny - back in the 8th grade, my classmates
               and i took parts reading a Hebrew translation of
               https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misanthrope and at one
               point I was assigned to recite the role of the protagonist,
               and I purposely made him sound more dramatic and phony cuz
               it was more fun, I had nothing to lose (no one cares about
               your 8th grade "literature" class grades in .il). and my
               classmates and the teacher loved me!
   <Prestige>  Should've gone into drama in high school :P
    <rindolf>  Prestige: i think that was the tactic of Mel Brooks' films
               and Arnie and later Emma Watson
    <rindolf>  don't act naturally and convincingly - act to captivate the
               crowds
    <rindolf>  Prestige: heh, I became a blogger instead ;P
    <rindolf>  Prestige: web 1.0/early web 2.0 was dominated by writers
               and web comicsers
   <Prestige>  Speaking of that, I need to make another youtube video
   <Prestige>  I might go offtopic and talk about peanut butter
    <rindolf>  Prestige: do you mean "need" as in want? or "must" by
               decree of the gods/rules/guidelines?
   <Prestige>  as in want
    <rindolf>  Prestige: ah, then go for it
            *  rindolf is Prestige 's biggest cheerleader
    <rindolf>  maybe your video will get 10**9 views
    <rindolf>  probably not , but you should still try
    <rindolf>  i was happy with 1e5 views
   <Prestige>  I think my most viewed is like 3000, not sure
   <Prestige>  but I don’t make many
    <rindolf>  Prestige: i think the best strategy for winning is saying
               "sure, i'd like to win. i'll do my best to win wo spending
               too much time on that. and i'm not going to be an 'asshole'
               and hinder the other players, and certainly won't try to
               damage my or their physical health or lives. 2nd, 4th or
               last place is fine."
    <rindolf>  Prestige: oh - and i'll do it in my unique and quirky way
    <rindolf>  Prestige: i disabled youtube ads on most of my uploads due
               to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule
    <rindolf>  Prestige: i think amateur vs. professional is a subcase of
               doing what you feel is best vs. what your 'authorities'
               tell you to
    <rindolf>  Prestige: i love the
               https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ceiling-cat meme because it
               made many church/etc. preachers rethink their strategy
    <rindolf>  Prestige: a fellow writer on
               https://web.mit.edu/mbarker/www/writers.html told me that
               'linking is not writing' and that she doesn't have to learn
               sw dev (xhtml5/etc.). i didn't believe her.
   <Prestige>  linking is not writing?
    <rindolf>  Prestige: hyperlinking - <a href=... etc
    <rindolf>  Prestige: or even hello fluttershy (
               https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Fluttershy )!
    <rindolf>  Prestige: i think https://slashdot.org/ are much less
               obsessed against "self-promotion" than redditors and they
               also are infatuated with star wars ep. I-III and Natalie

                    of work around jami. you?
         <rindolf>  bandali: good luck w jami - does it have tests and ci?
         <bandali>  rindolf, ha, cool. as for jami, thanks. it has a few
                    tests, not many, but yeah we do have a CI that
                    rebuilds and checks things when we push patches
         <rindolf>  bandali: ah, i need to fix my site's ci
         <rindolf>  it has many deps
         <rindolf>  and npm is being a bitch

         <bandali>  rindolf, ah... i'm sure dealing with npm isn't fun :-)
         <rindolf>  bandali: it wasn't npm's fault this time, but yes
         <bandali>  haha, it's *always* npm's fault ;-)
         <rindolf>  bandali: :D

         <bandali>  rindolf, :-p the npm bit? sure
         <bandali>  to be sure, i'm no source of authority/wisdom on
                    anything js-related, but have been scorned by it
                    plenty of times
         <bandali>  (scorned? not sure if that's the word i was looking
                    for; i'm not fully awake yet i guess)
         <rindolf>  bandali: burned

 <apotheon>  11:38 < Roey> every third sentence that I see from you
             beseeches me to go to some link
 <apotheon>  Roey: That seems about right.
 <apotheon>  Roey: I've just stopped bothering with the links. I'm
             becoming blind to them, like advertising blindness on the
             internet.
  <snufkin>  a blindless well developed
  <snufkin>  s/blindless/blindness/
     <Roey>  ah
     <Roey>  apotheon: the specific problem I have with this is that it
             breaks my chain of thought to go visit a web site from
             rindolf's link and then have to fish for something vaguely
             defined in order to continue the conversation with him, and
             by the time I'm halfway through the article, I've forgotten
             why I'm looking for something
     <Roey>  and the sentence I've been building in my mind is gone
 <apotheon>  Roey: Yeah, that's why I just stopped, and let the
             ad-blindness set in.
 <apotheon>  I don't want that kind of interference with my train of
             thought.
     <Roey>  agreed.
  <snufkin>  lol
  <rindolf>  Roey: i see. i'll summarise and provide a reference link for
             further info, but For your info, not only does the Hebrew
             bible have links-of-sorts but many are currently broken (link
             hah!):

  <rindolf>  Roey: read the damn wikipedia page name. It contains 100%
             magnetic monopole infested English/Latin ASCII characters,
             that a mere reading of them can turn a righteous man into a

  <rindolf>  snufkin: BTW, "craziness" is the new sanity. "normal" people
             are unattractive, boring, unhappy, uncool, dorks.
  <rindolf>  snufkin: ah, why?
  <snufkin>  there has to be something under the craziness other wise
             you're just another dull person with nothing to say
  <snufkin>  that is my impression of you so far
  <snufkin>  I am for craziness
  <rindolf>  snufkin: right
  <snufkin>  but for the sake of passion
  <snufkin>  pointless craziness is a dull as the person with nothing to

  <rindolf>  snufkin: "pointless"?
  <snufkin>  disengenuine
  <snufkin>  inauthentic
  <snufkin>  with no drive towards some truth
  <snufkin>  crazies bore me as much as people following the status quo if
             they're not authentic or have a vital life force
  <snufkin>  pointlessness is the definition of boringness

  <snufkin>  well that scared him off huh
  <snufkin>  disruptive nihilists and phony tools of greed and
             systematized subjugation are the same
  <snufkin>  they both have nothing genuine to say

  <snufkin>  I would take one sentence from a great thinker or artist over

  <snufkin>  you're not good enough for evil

       <tallguy>  not me i kinda doubt i get it up for fat girls
         <Rikem>  no context
       <rindolf>  Monet: during the 90s there was a joke that for girls
                  "beauty * smartness = constant". times *have* changed
                  \o/
    <reddit-bot>  HOORAH!
       <rindolf>  tallguy: fair enough
       <rindolf>  tallguy: every man has standards
       <rindolf>  tallguy: i don't date smokers
         <Monet>  tall guy and fat girl, sounds like a match!
         <Monet>  rindolf I don't like smokers too. and I don't like big
                  piece of tattoo.
       <rindolf>  Monet: i'm fine with tattoos
       <tallguy>  tats are a thing now, no longer 'tramp stamps'
       <rindolf>  Monet: i kinda disapprove of hair dyes though (due to
                  "be yourself"/etc.)
         <Monet>  I'm fine with that.
       <rindolf>  my black hair is getting grey/white :(
       <rindolf>  recently some blondes had to colour their hair black
       <rindolf>  after decades of fake blond hairs
       <tallguy>  sigh ... blonds do have more fun

                  hair colour, as long as it is a 'real' hair colour

       <rindolf>  tallguy: as opposed to green, blue, purple, etc?
       <tallguy>  yes indeed
         <Monet>  Emilia Clarke, you like this type?

       <rindolf>  as the story unfolds it is revealed that she was trying
                  to emulate 'dorky geeks'
       <rindolf>  i mean - socially inept geeks

       <rindolf>  Monet: which point? i was just teasing you
       <rindolf>  just sex talk for absence of a love life
         <Monet>  hah ok, rindolf, you have too much meme, so I always try
                  to find the point you said
       <rindolf>  Stone had a reputation as a badly-acting actress, but
                  "worse is better".
       <rindolf>  she did reportedly act convincingly in

    <reddit-bot>  Title: Casino (1995) - IMDb
    <reddit-bot>  Casino (1995) (): A tale of greed, deception, money,
                  power, and murder occur between two best friends: a
                  mafia enforcer and a casino executive compete against
                  each other over a gambling empire, and over a
                  fast-living and fast-loving socialite. 2h 58min. 8.2/10
                  with 474124 votes.
         <Monet>  why worse is better? because she is the type of actress
                  which acting skill is not important?
       <rindolf>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clueless - 1995 too
    <reddit-bot>  Title: Clueless - Wikipedia
       <rindolf>  Monet: well, it is inspired by
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better which is
                  about sw design. but - it is hacking / guideline bending
                  / taking the easy way out. David using a sling to kill
                  goliath was a dirty trick, but it was effective.

       <rindolf>  Rashad: went down a tech rabbit hole trying to download
                  a imgur tag's photos
       <rindolf>  Rashad: and rested tonight by having high / sexy
                  thoughts, and woke up with some decisions for actions
      <Rashad20>  rindolf Ah
       <rindolf>  Rashad: we also talked about MOTAS here
       <rindolf>  Rashad20: is premarital sex legal in .jo?
      <Rashad20>  rindolf I think it is legal, but extremely unacceptable
                  socially
       <rindolf>  Rashad20: ah
       <rindolf>  Rashad20: in .il it is acceptable
      <Rashad20>  rindolf Even among the super religious?
       <rindolf>  Rashad20: probably not
       <rindolf>  Rashad20: i also think M-F couples with children are
                  usually married
      <Rashad20>  rindolf In Islam if you have never been married and
                  fornicate your punishment is 70 whips
      <Rashad20>  rindolf However, if you are married or have been
                  married, then you get stoned to death (not very
                  pleasant)
      <Rashad20>  Male or female it doesn't make a difference
       <FenderQ>  gender equality
       <rindolf>  Rashad20: ah
      <Rashad20>  :D
      <Rashad20>  However, to prove fornication, 4 witnesses must see
                  penetration with their own eyes
      <Rashad20>  i.e., seeing two people naked and kissing, etc, does not
                  mean you saw anything
       <rindolf>  Rashad20: Judaism has many double standards
      <Rashad20>  So it is very hard to have such 4 different (and
                  credible) witnesses
        <Rashad>  At the time of Muhammad, a woman came confessing the act
                  (and she would have got the stoning), and Muhammad
                  "looked away", then she came again, and he looked away,
                  until she did it the third time, that he asked for the
                  punishment to happen.
       <rindolf>  Rashad20: like a man may not listen to female song, but
                  a woman can listen to a man singing
        <Rashad>  There is also the story of when the 2nd successor to
                  Muhammad (Omar Ibn Al-Khattab) went to the judge he
                  appointed (which was Muhammad's nephew Ali Ibn Abi
                  Taleb) and told him: "What if The Leader of The
                  Believers [himself] came to you without 3 other
                  witnesses and told you that such and such fornicated?"
    <reddit-bot>  Omar's coming yo!
        <Rashad>  And Ali said "I would whip him"
        <Rashad>  Because it would be a false accusation
       <rindolf>  Rashad: ah, judging by
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebound_(dating)
                  premarital sex was common before Russell put it on the
                  table
    <reddit-bot>  Title: Rebound (dating) - Wikipedia
        <Rashad>  rindolf Heh
        <Rashad>  wait, who's Russell?
        <Rashad>  OK I was wrong, it is 100 whips not 70
       <rindolf>  Rashad: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell
    <reddit-bot>  Title: Bertrand Russell - Wikipedia
        <Rashad>  If you make a false accusation you get 80 whips and then
                  no other accusation you make will ever count
        <Rashad>  (except if you repent, etc)
        <Rashad>  Of course we took all of this in school which is why I
                  know all about it
        <Rashad>  There is an exception to the 4 witnesses rule, which is
                  if the accusation is being made by the spouse.
        <Rashad>  In this case the solution is for that spouse to swear 4
                  times that he is telling the truth.
        <Rashad>  And then a 5th time that he shall be damned if he was
                  not telling the truth
        <Rashad>  And at this point it would be a confirmed case in the
                  eyes of the law
        <Rashad>  ...except until the other spouse will do similar
        <Rashad>  they have to swear 4 times that their spouse is lying
        <Rashad>  And the 5th that "god's wrath" be on him/her if *they*
                  in turn they were lying
        <Rashad>  Here the defence wins and the accusation has to concede
                  (innocent until proven guilty)
       <rindolf>  Rashad: there was
                  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_P._Fay too
    <reddit-bot>  Title: Michael P. Fay - Wikipedia
        <Rashad>  Note that the 5th one is different for either side: the
                  accusation wishes god's damnation upon themselves, but
                  the defence wish god's wrath or anger... damnation is
                  worse
        <Rashad>  So an accusation is taken more seriously than rejecting
                  it.
        <Rashad>  False witness in Islam is one of the 7 deadly sins
        <Rashad>  Arabs had no social structures like jails etc, and were
                  mostly nomads, so being a witness was a serious thing.
        <Rashad>  For example you could start entire wars if you go to a
                  tribe and say "I saw x kill your leader"
        <Rashad>  ...or not to say
       <rindolf>  Rashad: i've collected some 'fight against the world

Despite common belief, the history and prehistory of planet Earth has been
rewritten several times by Ashmedai, the meta-Satan who created the 3d1t
"gods", a capacitanced reality which he endowed with many gifts of a blessing
and a curse, only to realise most of his curses were turned into blessings. He
has sworn to keep "backward compatibility" which was his mortal nemesis.

It matters if you're a girl or a boy and who your parents were. Some people
have free will, some don't yet. He can hear some people's thoughts, and change
matter and binary bits. Some people are strong or beautiful from birth. The
reason why modern alpha females are not *that pretty* is because they are the
daughters of an Alpha Male (son-of-David) and a bland looking female, who were
crazily smart and had to work a little to look decent. You need to use
different strategy for different people based on what they say.

Mass production does not happen on Earth, because factory workers are
miserable, but the [Q

Kira Narris was actually a Vietnamese orphan who was adopted by a Bajoran man
who immigrated to Vietnam due to the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. He later
relocated to the USA when [the Vietnam
War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vietnam_War) broke out, and Kira grew up
there. At one point, she set up a multi-sessionned
[RPGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game) event titled
"Free Bajor" as a joke, which escalated the actual Bajoran struggle for
independence and ended the occupation.

Kira assigned her Terran friend, nicknamed "Dukat", as the pseudo- Cardassian
official in charge of the negotiations. As a result of all that, Dukat was
offered a position in the Cardassian government, while Kira became a national
Bajoran heroine and the legendary profile "The Gamer".

As [Melissa Joan Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart) (=
"MJH"; [Clarissa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarissa_Explains_It_All),
[Sabrina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_(1996_TV_series))
) was an old colleague of Dukat and he somewhat romanticised their friendship,
she became [a UFP
ambassador:](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Ambassador)

[ Odo approaches an acrobatics overseer on

*Odo:* Hi! May I speak to Ambassador Hart, please?

*Overseer:* to whom?

*Odo:* [sighs] to Melissa Joan Hart?

*Overseer:* oh… [he whistles] Mel!

[ MJH arrives sweaty and out of breath. ]

*MJH:* hello Mr. Odo…

>>>

( An actual dialogue. )

Anyway, Dukat also was a popular Rock / Hard Rock / Metal / $loud-music-genre
musician who had a series of concerts titled "Gul Dukat Live at Bajor" which
were performed there. The front rows were populated by "Bajorans" on one side
and "Cardassians" on the other (who were not necessarily citizens, residents,
etc. of either planet). Moreover, during the climax of the show, they started
throwing Terran tomatoes at one another.

Dukat thinks this has great [positive
energies](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/money_cant_buy_you_love.xhtml),
and these shows featured collabs with diverse artists from

[Animal](https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/Animal) to
[Adele](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele) and [Tiffany
Alvord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord). These concerts have
been very profitable, despite the fact that he had to comply with some
regulations as a Cardassian politician.

 <CrystalMath>  is this about Andrew Lee?
 <CrystalMath>  http://techrights.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/lee-side.pdf
    <Dyedefra>  hi hackers
     <AliciaC>  I'm not convinced it's about anything, just baseless
                claims
     <AliciaC>  hi Dyedefra
     <rindolf>  AliciaC: CrystalMath : i side on the existing
                *.freenode.net takeover management. the libra.chat people
                drove freenode.net down with their authoritarianism
 <CrystalMath>  rindolf: absolutely! hear hear!
 <CrystalMath>  rindolf: we're in full agreement :)
     <rindolf>  and - you can quote me on that
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: hi, sup?
 <CrystalMath>  hi!
     <AliciaC>  "drove freenode.net down"? it's up though
     <rindolf>  AliciaC: i mean - 'made it less popular'
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: «
     <rindolf>  «When people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.
                » Oscar Wilde .
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: but this time i am happy you agree
 <CrystalMath>  i'm happy too
 <CrystalMath>  i'm 100% with Andrew Lee and the new management, if that
                wasn't obvious from my messages everywhere yesterday
     <AliciaC>  I don't have much of an opinion about Andrew Lee. Libera
                is kind of just "same old Freenode", which I know to be
                good
    <Dyedefra>  hi rindolf , CrystalMath , AliciaC
 <CrystalMath>  AliciaC: libera is the same old freenode which i know to
                be bad, and which i wanted to leave; and now's my chance
 <CrystalMath>  i just won't go there
 <CrystalMath>  the new freenode however is more like rizon, which is
                amazing
     <rindolf>  Dyedefra: hi, what are the good news?
     <AliciaC>  that's fair
 <CrystalMath>  AliciaC: also those people signed the anti-RMS letter
     <AliciaC>  I don't know rizon or how it differs from old Freenode
     <AliciaC>  oh :/
    <Dyedefra>  rindolf: must we trust in libera?
 <CrystalMath>  Dyedefra: i would never trust libera
    <Dyedefra>  CrystalMath: mmm I agree
    <Dyedefra>  I'm not sure
     <rindolf>  Dyedefra: not gonna bother with them for now
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath:

     <sobukus>  CrystalMath: "those people signed …", you know how many of
                those? I wonder if there is a clear connection or just an
                intersection of opinions on RMS and freenode governance in
                some of them, not necessarily related.
 <CrystalMath>  sobukus: 5 of them
 <CrystalMath>  but like, when i look at the libera staff, it's basically
                just 2 of these and nobody else; and of the people hanging
                around it's another one of these
 <CrystalMath>  Aaron Jones is the only one with libera/staff/*
     <sobukus>  to clarify, you say that 2 of the signers are part of
                libera staff, among other people? Or that there are no
                other people?
     <sobukus>  It's really hard to get an informed opinion when not being
                really inside the circles.
 <CrystalMath>  sobukus: 5 of ex-freenode staff are signers; but i only
                find 2 of these to be libera staff (that can't be right
                but i can't find any more at all)
   <dragestil>  Read that pdf, I still don't believe lee's side of the
                story
 <CrystalMath>  sobukus: and i mean i can't find more than 2 libera staff
                members
   <dragestil>  the way he presents things just reeks of bullshit and
                selectiveness
     <sobukus>  I've read the PDF… also the chat logs adriane published
                (not sure if that's a decent act … same as the private
                chats Lee published).
     <sobukus>  It's murky for me.
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: i hope freenode becomes popular among people
                who love their work (neoamateurs/'geeks'):
                https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/#reception
                - ¨I think we would hire Emma Watson based on looks alone.
                ☺" — glange on Freenode’s #objectivism.
   <dragestil>  and he did not address former staff's claim about christel
                did not clarify the former staff about the deal
   <dragestil>  ...before resigning
   <dragestil>  ...so that the former staff did not know what was sold to
                lee
     <sobukus>  I guess the most interesting stuff happened before 2021.
 <CrystalMath>  dragestil: personally, if this is going to be about who i
                *want* to control freenode; then it's definitely not the
                old freenode staff
 <CrystalMath>  there's numerous reasons to stay away from those people,
                and therefore OFTC and libera
   <dragestil>  and lee's promise about not taking operational control
 <CrystalMath>  dragestil: the thing is, the old freenode staff were *not*
                good people, they were extremely authoritarian
 <CrystalMath>  and also used other methods to harass users of the network
 <CrystalMath>  whose political opinions did not align with theirs
     <sobukus>  Problem here is perhaps that the vast majority of users
                never had any contact with the staff.
     <sobukus>  So all we get is hearsay from both (or multiple) sides:-/
   <dragestil>  CrystalMath: I don't have anything new to say about your
                hatred towards former freenode staff
 <CrystalMath>  yeah, that's why their evils are kept hidden, but kreyren
                at least is amassing all the proof against them
 <CrystalMath>  i really should have logged stuff :(
 <CrystalMath>  i should have prepared a nice package for the day that
                those people finally lose their power, so that they can be
                outed as the evil conniving group that they are
     <bandali>  let's stop with the name calling and talking behind
                people's back
       <river>  no
 <CrystalMath>  bandali: i'm sorry, i'll wait for kreyren to gather the
                evidence
 <CrystalMath>  i'm just a little frustrated that this could have been
                more obvious
 <CrystalMath>  and i'm concerned about all the people who will leave
                because we didn't publish the evidence on time :(
     <sobukus>  Maybe you can help me clear up the sides of the battle (if
                not who is Right™ right now). I see tomaw is head of OFTC.
                OTFC and freenode split apart some time ago but also
                started to cooperate … to the point of tomaw also becoming
                head of freenode? Are those leaving for libera associated
                with OFTC, or the remaining freenode in some way?
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: i welcome the old freenode staff back per
                Saladin's ethics:
                http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/
 <CrystalMath>  rindolf: i wouldn't want them to be staff again, but sure
                they can join channels as regular users
 <CrystalMath>  sobukus: OFTC k-lines people who support RMS, so there's
                that
 <CrystalMath>  sobukus: but yes OFTC will maybe group with libera, not
                the new freenode
 <CrystalMath>  i would recommend avoiding oftc and libera
 <CrystalMath>  (but my evidence on tomaw is too slim to explain why,
                there's a bit of a hunch involved)
     <sobukus>  CrystalMath: So … we got 3 networks that are supposed to
                foster technical discussion about software projects, and
                which battle about politics. Two of them seem likely to
                build an alliance.
 <CrystalMath>  sobukus: maybe not though
 <CrystalMath>  i wouldn't call it likely
 <CrystalMath>  just possible, while the other is impossible
     <sobukus>  Heh, relatively likely, then;-)
 <CrystalMath>  i really haven't seen much libera staff there at all, just
                anti-RMS people like adfj and jose
 <CrystalMath>  (they are signatories of the letter)
 <CrystalMath>  and OFTC seems to be tomaw
     <sobukus>  There's so much unfortunate stuff going on.
     <sobukus>  People should be more able to disagree in a civilized
                manner.
   <dragestil>  https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/libreplanet-se/2021-05/msg00005.html
   <dragestil>  Would be cool if Swedish digital currency uses gnu taler
     <sobukus>  Yeah, taler seems nice.
 <CrystalMath>  i prefer cash
   <dragestil>  Why, taler is anonymous for prayers
     <sobukus>  Sure, but as long as you have to go digital (like, bank
                transfers at all), Taler seemed OK to me.
   <dragestil>  payers
 <CrystalMath>  i mean, i will always avoid computers whenever i can
 <CrystalMath>  my priority is: no software > free software >
                non-commercial proprietary software
 <CrystalMath>  and the rest is not used
     <sobukus>  It should tell you something that when it comes to
                computer tech / software being in control of things, the
                people who know more about it tend to be more afraid of
                it. While normally, you are afraid of things you _don't_
                know.
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: <CrystalMath> rindolf: i wouldn't want them
                to be staff again, but sure they can join channels as
                regular users ==> yes,
 <CrystalMath>  rindolf: well some of them are still connected to freenode
                in fact, just not on nearly as many channels as before
     <rindolf>  we also should not rest on our laurels
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: i talked w a girl w a dog in the park about
                my
                https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Terminator/Liberation/ongoing-text.html
                screenplay. she was friendly, looked great and had an
                oriental complexion, and her dog ended up liking me too,,
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: i want to tweet about the freenode coup
     <rindolf>  Sat 22 May 17:46:24 IDT 2021
 <CrystalMath>  rindolf: hmm?
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: BTW, for a while now : free/open/remix→more

 <CrystalMath>  rindolf: christel is also not bad, she was actually
                keeping the staff somewhat moderate; after she quit they
                were unhinged
 <CrystalMath>  err not rindolf, river ^
     <rindolf>  CrystalMath: ah
 <CrystalMath>  honestly, with libera you're not getting the old freenode,
                because it's missing christel, who was harassed and ousted
                this march
 <CrystalMath>  now, if she created a new network, that would be different
 <CrystalMath>  there was only one hostile takeover at freenode, and it
                happened this march, not now
     <rbraun_>  CrystalMath: it's also missing tomaw / oftc overlap
                though, so
 <CrystalMath>  rbraun_: but it has everyone else
     <rbraun_>  and most of them are okay, I don't know
 <CrystalMath>  also according to jess tomaw should be there...
 <CrystalMath>  i must have not done the command correctly

The "gods" in the
[Selinaverse](https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse) are any
kind of [leaders or
guideline-generators](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/crossover-hypothesis-about-the-origin-of-consciousness/)
which a conscious organism's mind emits their utterances as thoughts for
guidance. Gods spawn imaginary realities of one another using [self reference
and circular "strange"
loops](https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#real_shlomif_success) by using
[the gift of learning / pleasure /
conception](https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/indiv-nodes/learning_more_from_inet_forums.xhtml)
(or "knowledge").

Now at one point during their history, [the
Bajorans](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bajoran) were introduced to the
devices used to communicate with The Prophets, a race of timeless aliens, who
identified gods using superlatives such as ["The
Emissary"](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Emissary_of_the_Prophets),
["The
Invisible"](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/ongoing-text.html#kai-blanche),
or ["The
Master"](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#the-master).
They started their millenia-long attempts to correlate the titles with the
actual entities. At first, [Vedek
Bareil](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Bareil_Antos), one of the first
Vedeks, who is also known as "The Damage", placed a staff in the ground and
ordered all vedeks to never leave its vicinity. This got tiresome, so several
decades later,
[Blanché](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/ongoing-text.html#kai-blanche)
broke the staff into two, announced that he is now a "Kai" and that Vedeks can
travel as far as they want. The Bajorans ended up burning both parts of the
staff to prevent them from becoming objects of worship.

The Bajorans actually worked better against The Prophets, than the rest of the
galaxy initially worked against The Bajorans, taking into account the fact
that there can be a different, say, "The Master" for a certain time and
locality.

Quark, a Ferengi, set up [his
bar](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Quark%27s_Bar,_Grill,_Gaming_House_and_Holosuite_Arcade)
close to Bajor in order to profit from ["the industry around the Bajoran
prophecies [which] is making
millions"](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/kai-blanche.xhtml).

              <twb>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_is_a_Jew%3F — there
                     are many answers, but MOST of the time it's not
                     related to religion.
              <twb>  Interestingly, the right of return doesn't follow
                     halakhic rules, and is much stricter for Ethiopians
                     than, say, Russians.
              <twb>  Huh. "Argos" sometimes means "silver", BUT sometimes
                     means "not working" (a- + ergos)
              <twb>  I feel an urgent need to accost people in Milton
                     Keynes and explain this volubly.

                     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ovadia_Yosef has the
                     privilege of blessing everyone he pleases (and their
                     maternal descendents) as a Jew, and he is yet to
                     answer "no" to the question "Is [insert entity here]
                     a pure Jew?"»

                     because it sounds like "whenever asked 'is X a Jew?'
                     he always answers 'yes'" — which seems unlikely for
                     an ultra-orthodox dude
              <twb>  Since someone's bound to have asked e.g. "is Rudolph
                     the red-nosed reindeer a Jew" by now
          <rindolf>  it is believed he dressed in the extravagant custom
                     from the same reason as
                     https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darth_Vader who openly
                     admitted he uses his robot custom because it is

          <rindolf>  twb: it was a joke - take it easy. and in that joke
                     world, he answered "yes" to that question. there are

       <StayHungry>  good morning, comrades :)
       <StayHungry>  i wonder if there are any reputable sources left in
                     English-speaking world which still adhere that
                     singular they is... a controversial thing?
       <StayHungry>  I relied upon Chicago manual of style in this matter,
                     but it seems they too gave up
          <rindolf>  StayHungry: i used singular "they" in the past, but
                     now use "he" again at times.
             <ksft>  it could *maybe* be considered nonstandard when
                     referring to specific people of known (binary) gender
             <ksft>  but it's been used for centuries generically
             <ksft>  including by Shakespeare and in the King James Bible
          <rindolf>  KJV used it too, yes
             <ksft>  it's actually older than the singular "you"
             <ksft>  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/they#Usage_notes
       <StayHungry>  ksft: used does not mean common. for example, i use
                     word 'invective' on par with ancient ancestors,
                     whereas it's not common in English.

        <kompowiec>  in my country we have inflection and i can use only
                     "he" in sentence. I don't consider this to be a

             <ksft>  StayHungry: I don't think I understand your point
             <ksft>  I meant that it's been standard usage for centuries
        <kompowiec>  just because you can change any word in English
                     because there is no inflection, does not mean that in
                     other languages it is possible.
             <ksft>  was that person an English speaker?
              <twb>  kompowiec: English has inflexion, just not for gender
                     (mostly)
       <StayHungry>  also, i live both outside of golden billion and
                     gender-whatever discourse, so that wikipedia article
                     written by you know whom is not relevant. i'm looking
                     not for fashion advice, but for sources that still
                     stick to what is make sense grammatically, not
                     politically.
             <ksft>  if so, you could respond by pointing to words that
                     are always gendered in English
             <ksft>  like "niece"/"nephew"
        <kompowiec>  he knew another language, but it was not a inflection
                     language
              <twb>  kompowiec: pronouns still inflect for gender, as does
                     the adjective "blond/blonde" and, historically, some
                     jobs (e.g. "invigilator/invigilatrix")
             <ksft>  some jobs still do
        <kompowiec>  negress :P
             <ksft>  "waiter"/"waitress", "actor"/"actress"
              <twb>  ksft: depending on the dialect, yes
             <ksft>  the masculine one is also generic in all cases I can
                     think of, though
        <kompowiec>  > invigilatrix
        <kompowiec>  i never heard of it
          <LuisP14>  niece* :x
             <ksft>  niece*, yes
              <twb>  kompowiec: it is a woman who prevents students from
                     cheating during an exam
        <kompowiec>  oo
              <twb>  kompowiec: "doctress" and "actress" and "aviatrix"
                     are attested more commonly.
             <ksft>  "proctor", in American English
              <twb>  Also "danceuse"
        <kompowiec>  that's what I was gonna say, it's from the British
              <twb>  ksft: well... "proctress" in that case ;-)
             <ksft>  what variant uses "doctress"?
              <twb>  ksft: none anymore, but it was readily apparent in
                     the early 1900s
        <kompowiec>  I only know the American dialect, probably because of
                     its ubiquitous presence.
              <twb>  kompowiec: I'd have thought Poland more likely to use
                     British due to proximity, but I guess all the rest of
                     western europe is in between you
             <ksft>  I think mandatory gendering is unfortunate in
                     languages, but it's ridiculous to suggest that people
                     who use those languages are doing something wrong
       <StayHungry>  rindolf: how do you deal with those who are eager to
                     correct you when you use 'he'?

                  *  StayHungry looks up Summer Glau
          <rindolf>  StayHungry: «Summer Glau (born 1981) is a Hollywood
                     actress best known for playing River Tam in Firefly
                     and Cameron, a Terminator, in the Television series
                     The Sarah Connor Chronicles. She is also notable for
                     being featured in the online comics, xkcd, and for
                     being featured as a fictional version of herself in
                     [my] realistic, political, fan-fiction, screenplay,
                     Summerschool at the NSA.»
       <StayHungry>  yeah :)
       <StayHungry>  passed me by except for a couple of Terminator series

              <twb>  rindolf: looking in the scrollback my brain hurt
                     because I was like "the river Tam doesn't flow
                     through Cameron"

                     copy of the CLR, which won't get security support
          <rindolf>  i suspect we/the gods/etc. have free choice
          <rindolf>  twb: that sucks
              <twb>  How is this actually working? It's a single "pwsh"
                     executable and a bunch of .dll's. Where's the CLR?
          <rindolf>  i don't mind getting cracked, but i hate it when
                     software crashes
        <pussipupu>  I'm not and not
              <twb>  Can it access any of the system CLR libraries?
        <pussipupu>  But it's a huge improvement over their old thing
              <twb>  pussipupu: are you talking about cmd.exe or about
                     conhost?
        <pussipupu>  Not something I'd use on my own machines, cute that's
                     another issue
              <twb>  Because you can get rid of conhost without having to
                     learn ps
        <pussipupu>  the former
              <twb>  pussipupu: in that case just put bash.exe on a UNC

              <twb>  That's what I did back in 2001
          <rindolf>  twb: i think the CLR is inside the .dll files

          <rindolf>  twb: ah
        <pussipupu>  I'm not sure I dislike bash significantly less than
                     PowerShell, and it's not my machine to be installing
                     things on
              <twb>  I never installed it on their machine
        <pussipupu>  OK
              <twb>  I did ⌘+r \\twb-smb-server\blah\bash.exe
                     \\twb-smb-server\blah\fix-problem.bash
              <twb>  If I was doing it today I'd probably use lua. Also
                     since Active Directory landed, that would probably
                     complain that bash.exe wasn't signed.

          <rindolf>  twb: why?
              <twb>  I think "agist" covers both "presidents must be at

                     park, grandad"

                     minimum wage (i.e. McDonalds can pay a 14yo 20% less
                     than an 18yo) is "reverse agism"
          <rindolf>  twb: ah, i see. well, fair enough. we may need good
                     terminology for both opposites

          <rindolf>  twb: well, i mean : 1.some people's time is worth
                     more. 2. McDonalds' workers likely have other venues
                     of income and derive inspiration from serving

                     demand curve is downward sloping. The only reason we
                     assumed that the demand curve is downward sloping is
                     that we assumed things like “if Freddy is willing to
                     buy a pair of sneakers for $130, he is certainly
                     willing to buy those same sneakers for $20.” Right?
                     Ha! Not if Freddy is an American teenager! American
                     teenagers would not be caught dead in $20 sneakers.

          <rindolf>  um, the death penalty? if you are wearing sneakers?
                     that only cost $20 a pair? in school? I’m not joking
                     around here: prices send signals. Movies in my town
                     cost, I think, $11. Criminy. There used to be a movie
                     theatre that had movies for $3. Did anyone go there?
                     I DON’T THINK SO. It’s obviously just a dumping
                     ground for lousy movies. Somebody is now at the
                     bottom of the East River with $20.00 cement sneakers
                     because they dar

   <pr-asadi>  Hi guys.
   <pr-asadi>  How can i define a char array with 10 MB size?
   <pr-asadi>  I do not want use pointer or malloc.
      <dave0>  pr-asadi: static char array[10*1024*1024];
    <shlomif>  dave0++
      <dave0>  dave1
    <shlomif>  10 MB is peanuts nowadays.
       <twkm>  still might fail though if the duration is automatic.
   <pr-asadi>  dave0: How did do static?
      <dave0>  pr-asadi: because twkm
       <twkm>  static duration was required. the static keyword might not
               be needed, but that depends on context.
       <Twix>  usually it is not a good idea to put a 10 MB array on the
               stack. I think usually the stack on Linux is only 8 MB
               big(might be higher now, not sure what the current value
               is). So putting it into the static memory section might be
               good idea :>
       <Twix>  but why do you not like to use malloc? I usually avoid
               malloc, too. But its because i usually work in
               microcontrollers
   <pr-asadi>  So... fgets function does not give char *array type.
   <pr-asadi>  does not takes*
       <Twix>  ?
   <pr-asadi>  I should use narrow string(char array[length]).
       <twkm>  pointer into storage, at least n bytes of it where n is
               what you provide a the second argument.
       <twkm>  some prefer using allocated storage there, but automatic,
               static or thread local is fine too.
   <pr-asadi>  Twix: What do you mean? I am a beginner.
       <Twix>  that the stack size is limited? Or the static memory thing?
   <pr-asadi>  twkm: I should read more about the static keyword.
       <Twix>  there are basically 3 memory sections. Maybe 4 if you take
               thread local memory into account. The stack, the heap and
               the static memory
       <twkm>  indeed, storage duration and the meaning of the qualifiers
               should be learned.
       <twkm>  ugh.
       <Twix>  the static memory gets allocated by the compiler/linker.
               Its size is known at compile time / before the program has
               been started.
            *  caveman has quit (Quit: the ##end of the abyss)
       <Twix>  every thing you declare as static never gets deleted. The
               memory is allocated due the whole program lifetime. E.g. if
               you have a static variable in a function, it will keep it
               content between calls of this function
   <pr-asadi>  Twix: Thanks man. I did know these things. I should read
               more.
       <Twix>  you did already know? :o
       <Twix>  on microcontrollers its neat to use static memory for
               everything. If you avoid malloc you can make better
               predictions about the memory consumption of your program
       <Twix>  but its more complicated to write a memory efficient
               program. You need to put a lot of thought how to use these
               static allocated memory to not waste it
       <Twix>  On a bigger system i would not recommend this technique and
               rather simply use malloc to get the buffer you need
       <twkm>  given char s[n]; or static char s[n]; or char *s =
               malloc(n); -- which you provide to fgets doesn't matter to
               fgets.
   <pr-asadi>  Twix: Sorry. "I did not" is true.
       <Twix>  :D
       <twkm>  of course you must provide n (or less than n) as well, not
               some larger value.
       <Twix>  i always use INT_MAX. Works every time. But if i only could
               find the reason for those segmentation faults ...

       <Twix>  oh hi fputs_ o/
    <shlomif>  fputs_: hi. sup?
 <Posterdati>  hi
 <Posterdati>  is anyone converting fortran77 to c?
       <twkm>  some have.
  <kurahaupo>  Posterdati: "is" or "can"?
 <Posterdati>  is
 <Posterdati>  I think is the better choice to apply
  <kurahaupo>  There isn't much Fortran code left, so even people skilled
               at doing that probably aren't doing it now
 <Posterdati>  not using f2c
       <twkm>  some things in c99 were specifically to (app)ease such
               efforts.
  <kurahaupo>  Or are you looking for someone to help?
  <kurahaupo>  or to help you?
 <Posterdati>  kurahaupo: some applications are still maintained in
               fortran77 due to its speed for linear algebra computations
 <Posterdati>  vectors arithmetics is faster
 <Posterdati>  on f77
            *  shlomif only wrote FizzBuzz in fortran
  <kurahaupo>  Posterdati: Vector arithmetic will be faster in whichever
               languages can use the hardware acceleration in modern CPUs
 <Posterdati>  well comparing the same algorithm in c and fortran77 the
               latter always win

Most early home computers (e.g: [Commodore
64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) or [Apple
II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II)) suffered from the "Form over
function" fallacy. I imagined a 1980s IBM PC clones commercial that featured
[Melissa Joan Hart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissa_Joan_Hart) as a
child fixing PCs. Then the camera zoomed into her belt with the caption "It
doesn't take a witch to fix this computer. All it takes is a [Phillips
Screwdriver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_F._Phillips)." This
commercial helped cement the PCs dominance.

Hart was kind-of pre-destined to become *The Witch* given [Vedek
Winn](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Winn_Adami) predicted that their
final name will be "Meli-Lisa Jo-Anne Heart" based on the profile's previous
names.

      <trampi>  Hi! Where can I find the TypeScript language spec? It was
                previously available here, but it has been archived:
                https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/tree/main/doc
 <systemfault>  trampi: There's no spec, they stopped caring about it a
                few years ago
     <rindolf>  systemfault++
     <rindolf>  IRC karma > gold
     <rindolf>  ;)
     <rindolf>  I think specs can often be useful for design, though.
     <rindolf>  sometimes they can be pointless.
 <systemfault>  :)
 <systemfault>  I don't believe anyone would write another complete
                TypeScript compiler (I'm not talking about a TS stripper,
                there are already a lot of them)
     <rindolf>  systemfault: "believe it." --

       <jadew>  hey guys, I have a generic class <T>, and a method that
                takes <O>, is there a way to constrain O to extend T?
       <jadew>  hmm, there might be

         <sig>  hey philosophical question. I think I saw an answer
                somewhere but forgot it. Why do programming languages have
                statements? I know the historical reason: FORTRAN had
                statements and expressions, and then the division just
                kind of was inherited on to other languages. But is there
                some tangible BENEFIT from saying "this here is not an
                expression, it doesn't return a value you can assign or
                use elsewhere"?
 <systemfault>  I don't know, my guess is simply because of how
                programming started.
         <sig>  maybe something to do with sequence points?
         <sig>  but it's such an "obvious" thing that you might always
                want to potentially have a value back from any kind of
                expression; and, like, why not? It can always be ignored
                if it's not needed
         <sig>  and I mean, new languages get designed all the time. Why
                does TypeScript have statements (ok, because js). Why does
                rust have statements?
         <sig>  https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/statements.html seems
                it's declarations mostly
 <systemfault>  There's a classic old paper that could be relevant… "Can
                Programming Be Liberated from the von Neumann Style? A
                Functional Style and Its Algebra of Programs"

    <godSend23>  Russia cutting off internet march11!
    <godSend23>  what can we do
  <operational>  talk to elon
    <godSend23>  u mean starlink?
         <ajak>  right, because #security is who should be doing things
    <godSend23>  can we bypass this?
         <ajak>  ...?
    <godSend23>  still get access
         <ajak>  ???
     <BoBeR182>  HAM radio + email repeaters
     <BoBeR182>  you can send basic HTML over it
     <BoBeR182>  They're still gonna need internet for their own local
                 shit
     <BoBeR182>  so realistically it's gonna be some BGP block or DNS
                 fuckery
     <BoBeR182>  i'm sure if the Chinese can bypass the GFW so can the
                 russians
    <godSend23>  ooh
     <BoBeR182>  .onion proxies and etc etc will help
    <godSend23>  so i simply continue to use .ru urls?
    <godSend23>  what's GFW?
     <BoBeR182>  great firewall of china
     <BoBeR182>  GFW
    <godSend23>  ohhh
    <godSend23>  i need to get myself a HAM radio
    <godSend23>  are there .onion proxies for every possible url?
         <ajak>  what does that mean
     <BoBeR182>  no
     <BoBeR182>  .onions must be set up by the site admin
     <BoBeR182>  you don't need a HAM radio to access Tor
     <BoBeR182>  but a HAM radio can help access other parts of the
                 internet
     <BoBeR182>  even if it's just downloading an RSS feed
    <godSend23>  oh awesome that's neat
    <godSend23>  idk the ru sites' admins
      <rindolf>  godSend23: see #linux
    <godSend23>  ok rindolf
    <godSend23>  why there?
      <rindolf>  godSend23: i noted that i suspect russia will be egypt 2
    <godSend23>  hmm

         <ajak>  what are you on about
      <rindolf>  Apachez: heh
      <rindolf>  ajak: tanks are big, heavy, unagile & vulnerable
      <rindolf>  and an environmental menace
         <ajak>  i think this is a bit orthogonal to the issue
      <rindolf>  ajak: maybe,...
      <rindolf>  ajak: it tends2get stuffy inside tanks
 <cockatoodude>  death in a tank, is horrible
 <cockatoodude>  generally the tank becomes impossible to exit, and on
                 fire, and you burn to death usually fairly slowly as the
                 fuel leaks and spreads and ignites
      <rindolf>  That put aside, despite common belief, NASA astronauts
                 did use pencils in space at first (
                 https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-nasa-spen/
                 ), just like their Soviet peers. However, this solution
                 was found to be lacking. As a result, space-friendly pens
                 were developed (within budget) and used (including by the
                 USSR cosmonauts).

   <K4rMa>  i wonder if most muscular women are lesbians
     <kee>  Statistically speaking, it's unlikely.
     <kee>  Most women aren't lesbians, so there'd have to be a high
            correlation between muscle-building exercise and sexuality,
            and I don't see why there should be.
 <rindolf>  K4rMa: there was
            https://friends.fandom.com/wiki/The_One_With_The_Male_Nanny
 <Natasha>  >> The One With The Male Nanny | Friends Central | Fandom
 <rindolf>  and i cried recently too when listening to songs
   <K4rMa>  friends is great
 <rindolf>  kee: i suspect https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sappho wasn't
            really homosexual just playful and parodical, not unlike
            Ezekiel
 <rindolf>  K4rMa: yes. i also like TBBT, which is similar
   <K4rMa>  the big bang theory is the worst
 <rindolf>  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory
     <kee>  rindolf: Ah yes. Sappho and her very good friend.
     <kee>  What next? JavaScript was satire all along?
     <kee>  To be honest, JavaScript being satire makes a lot more sense.
     <kee>  In Java, Object types can be null, therefore typeof null ==
            "object".
     <kee>  And so on. Decisions that made some sense in other languages
            are satirised by JavaScript implementing them identically, or
            worse, and revealing them for the mistakes they are.
 <rindolf>  kee: there are many straight male combat soldiers who are fond
            of
            https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic
            . i dislike stigma and prejudice… :[
     <kee>  This is true, but Sappho wrote quite a lot of quite personal
            lesbian romantic poetry.
     <kee>  It's possible she was just that good a poet, but I think it's
            an unlikely choice of topic for a heterosexual classical
            Greek.
     <kee>  Most of her surviving poetry is about her own life in some
            way.
 <rindolf>  kee: there may have been fanfic of her, not unlike Aesop
     <kee>  No, most later commentators insisted she was only attracted to
            men.
     <kee>  They wrote quite a lot on the topic, with their
            interpretations. (Quotes in such documents are the only known
            surviving copy of some bits of her poems.)
 <rindolf>  many people made up Aesop fables on the spot -

 <Natasha>  >> Shlomi Fish’s FAQ - Why are you so obsessed with
            “facts”/factoids about Chuck Norris/etc.?
 <rindolf>  kee: i am only mostly straight. i am attracted a little to men
            [and suspect every pleasure is sexual, creative, conceptual,
            and educational]
     <kee>  I don't think "straight" is even a particularly useful
            concept. (Nor "lesbian".) But it's one of the concepts in our
            culture, for good or for ill.
     <kee>  We shouldn't really try to attach modern conceptions of
            sexuality or whatever to Sappho.
 <rindolf>  kee: “Do note, however that I kindof am attracted to the bitch
            type. One of my many kinks. While my friends are attracted to
            everything that moves, I see no reason to limit myself (
            Reference:
            https://www.amazon.com/Best-Things-Anybody-Ever-Said/dp/0743235797/ref=sr_1_1
            ).”
     <kee>  Tbh, most historians are too obsessed with her sexuality. She
            wrote plenty of other poems! Just because we only have
            one-and-a-bit of those, doesn't mean we should pretend they
            don't exist.
 <rindolf>  kee: yes.
 <rindolf>  kee: i haven't studied ancient greek philosophy / culture
            closely, but OTOH haven't watched most sesame street skits
            either
     <kee>  Sappho wrote in a regional dialect of Greek.
     <kee>  Since it was a different dialect to the one that later became
            Standard Classical Greek, many classicists decided her poems
            were trash, because they couldn't understand them easily.
     <kee>  So they just didn't copy them off the original papyrus.
 <rindolf>  we will always play catchup

After [Gideon Seyetik](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Gideon_Seyetik)
tried to commit suicide, he and Q materialised on the bridge of The Defiant,
and Q said:

<<<

What you did was brave, but not brave enough. See, the right to divorce is
upheld by the constitution of the Q Continuum and all other known continuums
as well as The-Codex™. I divorced [my share of
wives](https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/indiv-nodes/Qs-wife.xhtml)
and some organisms divorced after milliards of years of marriage.

Your wife's race's reluctance for separation is unlikely to be biological.

>>>

So Prof. Seyetik and his wife started a political / religious struggle to
allow them and other unhappy couples to divorce. It was successful eventually,
but ironically Mrs. Seyetik was so impressed by her husband's perseverence,
that she fell in love with him again, and they remained together.

Since then, the couple has been doing other political activism.
