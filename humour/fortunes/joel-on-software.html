That’s a huge difference, and when I talked to some friends from Microsoft Consulting Services about this they admitted that Microsoft had lost a whole generation of developers. The reason it takes $130,000 to hire someone with COM experience is because nobody bothered learning COM programming in the last eight years or so, so you have to find somebody really senior, usually they’re already in management, and convince them to take a job as a grunt programmer, dealing with (God help me) marshalling and monikers and apartment threading and aggregates and tearoffs and a million other things that, basically, only Don Box ever understood, and even Don Box can’t bear to look at them any more.</p></blockquote><table class="info"><tbody><tr class="author"><td class="field"><b>Author</b></td><td class="value">Joel Spolsky</td></tr><tr class="work"><td class="field"><b>Work</b></td><td class="value"><a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html">How Microsoft Lost the API War</a></td></tr></tbody></table></div><div class="fortune"><div class="head"><h3 id="joel-camels-rubber-duckies-1">Joel on Software - On the Pricing of Software</h3><p class="disp"><a href="show.cgi?id=joel-camels-rubber-duckies-1">Display</a></p></div><blockquote><p>One of the biggest questions you’re going to be asking now is, “How much should I charge for my software?” When you ask the experts they don’t seem to know.

The competition has no choice but to spend all their time porting and keeping up, time that they can’t spend writing new features. Look closely at the software landscape.

The companies who stumble are the ones who spend too much time reading tea leaves to figure out the future direction of Microsoft. People get worried about .NET and decide to rewrite their whole architecture for .NET because they think they have to. Microsoft is shooting at you, and it’s just cover fire so that they can move forward and you can’t, because this is how the game is played, Bubby. Are you going to support Hailstorm? SOAP? RDF? Are you supporting it because your customers need it, or because someone is firing at you and you feel like you have to respond? The sales teams of the big companies understand cover fire. They go into their customers and say, “OK, you don’t have to buy from us. Buy from the best vendor. But make sure that you get a product that supports (XML / SOAP / CDE / J2EE) because otherwise you’ll be Locked In The Trunk.” Then when the little companies try to sell into that account, all they hear is obedient CTOs parroting “Do you have J2EE?” And they have to waste all their time building in J2EE even if it doesn’t really make any sales, and gives them no opportunity to distinguish themselves.

Pretty soon it became an in-house bug tracking system. It got embellished almost daily with features that people needed until it was good enough that it no longer justified any more work.</p><p>Various friends asked me if they could use FogBUGZ at their companies. The trouble was, it had too many hardcoded things that made it a pain to run anywhere other than on the original computer where it was deployed. I had used a bunch of SQL Server stored procedures, which meant that you needed SQL Server to run FogBUGZ, which was expensive and overkill for some of the two person teams that wanted to run it. And so on. So I would tell my friends, “gosh, for $5000 in consulting fees, I’ll spend a couple of days and clean up the code so you can run it on your server using Access instead of SQL Server.” Generally, my friends thought this was too expensive.</p><p>After this happened a few times I had a revelation — if I could sell the same program to, say, three people, I could charge $2000 and come out ahead. Or thirty people for $200. Software is neat like that. So in late 2000, Michael sat down, ported the code so that it worked on Access or SQL Server, pulled all the site-specific stuff out into a header file, and we started selling the thing.
