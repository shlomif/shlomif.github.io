However, I am taking it a little further. I hope Ms. Grimmie is not offended by me comparing her, who despite her early low-quality cover videos, is almost entirely perfectly normal and wonderful in any way, to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a> whose words, deeds, and personal life, both exhibited many issues that seem appalling in 2014, and were often quite objectionable even back then.</p><p>My point is that both Ayn Rand at the time and Christina Grimmie now, are at the cutting-edge of influencing the world and taking it forward instead of backward (despite whatever faults they both had or have). Back in Ayn Rand&#8217;s time books and the early Hollywood feature films were the primary vehicle for influence. In this day and age, however, songs and other videos on YouTube, especially by &#8220;independent&#8221; cover artists, are what bring the most long-term (and usually positive) influence among the people who matter most (= the &#8220;Alphas&#8221;).</p><p>Sorry for the long explanation.</p><p>Some links:</p><ul><li><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23TeamGrimmie&amp;src=typd">#TeamGrimmie Twitter hashtag</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://plus.google.com/+ShlomiFish/posts/dDJwvtcGE5N">&#8220;Buffy is not a nobody&#8230;&#8221;</a> - about why you should believe in yourself, think you're the most powerful person on Earth, and even the messiah, proudly say that &#8220;I am [Insert Name and/or Nickname here]&#8221;, and realise that you can &#8220;kick some ass&#8221;, change the world for the better, improve yourself and what you achieve, and eventually become a &#8220;winner&#8221; (even if you do not take first place at every silly-or-not-so-silly competition).
