Then I said &#8220;So that's one thing you can't say&#8221; and so now I'm saying it here (although it seems the world is ready for it).</p><p>Just for the record, I am an Israeli Jew and my late (and loved) grandfather on my father's side (who was a Polish-born Jew) lost track of most of his family during World War II. However, I think whether or not the holocaust happened is just an irrational "a-point" without respect to "The Point" of WWII history, which is if we look at the global picture we will see that the only reason for all the killing and destruction was that the Nazis leadership ordered to do that, and it was entirely pointless. Focusing on the historical details is losing the forest for the trees.</p><p>I took the picket fence image from <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Vandalized_picket_fence.jpg">MediaWiki commons</a> and this captioned image is under CC-by too. Share and enjoy. In case you're wondering, it alludes to the iconic fences of the Nazis concentration and death camps. The fact that parts of it are absent is not relevant ( <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2011/08/12/just-a-cigar/">"Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar"</a>. )</p><p>I used GIMP, Inkscape and gwenview in the preparation of this image. Thanks goes to UnconventionalIT, and Ankh from #gimp for some assistance.</p><p><b>Note to Americans and Israelis:</b> you may not find this captioned image provocative or offensive, because in the United States and Israel, there's much less taboo against treating the acts of the Nazis as holy. ( This may be a good thing. ) A typical Israeli if told that the Holocaust did not happen would likely say "Assuming that was the case, would that make the Nazis angels? Get real!". This image is primarily intended at Europeans as intellectual activism.</p><p>Also note that I actually think the Holocaust <b>did happen</b>, but still believe that people should be free to claim otherwise due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech">the freedom of speech</a>.</p></article></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../../"><img src="../../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
