I suspect "le-nab&#233;" meant "to be crazy / to act crazy" including in today's casual sense. These philosophers were treated with the same contempt as we now treat actors, models or most recently (as of 2014) &#8212; reality T.V. show contestants, or independent (covers/parodies/remixes/etc.) artists on YouTube and other social media and Web resources (e.g.: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTuber">YouTubers</a>).</p><p>Many philosophers were joking and didn't take their philosophies seriously. They were often <a href="../../../humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">amateur</a> (= artists or workers who enjoy their work, regardless of how much or how little they were paid; a.k.a: "geeks") and polymaths, who accepted different opinions, or people who built, parodied, and expanded upon their work.</p><p>I suspect that despite what Jaynes describes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)">his book</a>, most of the good nev'im and story tellers of ancient times were only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanic</a> (= mildly manic) at worse, or possibly manic, who satirised fanatical or cynical zealots, often spoke in prose, drama or freeform verse, and were in effect "stand-up comedians".</p></article></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../../"><img src="../../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
