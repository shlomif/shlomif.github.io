I studied home economics at College and then I went to Memphis and opened a small restaurant of my own. But people there didn&#8217;t like the fact of a woman being a chef, so they never went to my restaurant.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Elizabeth:</strong> So, I moved to Philadelphia, which is a more liberal city. And then all the women-liberation activists got excited, and my restaurant was full just because I was a woman chef. But I want to be appreciated because of my food, not because I&#8217;m a woman. So, I decided to move to England, where they have achieved greater progress regarding women-rights.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dominique:</strong> And you were discriminated because of your sex, again. Oh dear!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Elizabeth:</strong> No. People flocked to my restaurant, just because I was the only American chef in London.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Elizabeth:</strong> So, I moved to the Canary islands, where people thought my food was a nice change, and didn&#8217;t care much about me being a woman or not. And then Gail came by, and I decided to join him on his endless travels.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Catherine:</strong> Interesting life story.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The men come by and sit down. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dominique:</strong> So, you&#8217;re back.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Roark:</strong> Yep.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> So, what do you want to do next? I can arrange for another yacht tour, or we can go to Florida and explore the swamps&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Keating:</strong> Actually, Gail, I think we had enough recreation for now, and Howard and I will just head back to New-York.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> Oh come on! Surely, there&#8217;s something you&#8217;d like to do&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Roark:</strong> Hmmm&#8230; not really. And besides, you&#8217;re Gail Wynand, and you can arrange everything, so it kind of renders all the fun out of it&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Keating:</strong> Hold it right there! But, what if we go <b class="bold">against</b> Gail Wynand.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> You mean that I arrange to get you all killed, and you will try to stay alive? <span class="inlinedesc">[He has an evil grin on his face.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Keating:</strong> Now, that would be an exciting challenge. So what do you all say?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Roark and the women:</strong> &#8220;Yes&#8221;, &#8220;Sounds nice&#8221;, &#8220;We&#8217;re in&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> Okay. How about that: I drop you off at the Mexican shore, and you&#8217;ll try to get to the U.S., where you&#8217;ll be safe.</p></div></section></main>
