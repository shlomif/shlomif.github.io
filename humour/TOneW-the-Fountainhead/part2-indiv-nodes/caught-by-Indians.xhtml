It&#8217;s afternoon and Roark and Keating are walking in the middle of the desert. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Keating:</strong> You know, walking in the desert and avoiding those towns, was a good idea to stay out of trouble. But I&#8217;m getting thirsty. What do you say we sneak to a well?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Roark:</strong> As you wish, Peter.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Suddenly, many Indians spring from various hiding places around the two, aiming guns and loaded bows at them. Roark and Keating see them and quickly raise their hands. The Indian chief signals them to move to the right, and the two walk that way, followed by several armed Indians who are guarding them. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Keating:</strong> Do you suppose Gail has anything to do with it?</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut. It&#8217;s night. A long shot of a large wooden platform, with a tall wooden pole somewhere in its left side. The entire Indian tribe gathered in front of the platform.</p><p>Close up on the pole. Keating is tied to it, and an Indian is finishing tying up Roark. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Roark:</strong> Peter, I have a confession to make. I didn&#8217;t really show it, but I actually like you. And I really appreciate how you helped me and Cameron.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Keating:</strong> Gee, Roark, it&#8217;s nice to hear that. I will cherish that thought for the next couple of&#8230; minutes.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The Indian crowd start cheering and shouting. Long shot, then close up on the Indian chieftain who is standing in the middle of the platform. He knocks three times with his staff, and the crowd silences. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Indian Chief:</strong> Gaaaaiiiiill Wynand! We love thee! We need thee! We worship thee!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The crowd start cheering and shouting again. The chief knocks two times with his staff, and the crowd silences again. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Indian Chief:</strong> Gaaaaiiiiill Wynand! We call for thee!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Sparks of light appear on one spot in the platform, and then there&#8217;s smoke, and Wynand appears out of it. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> Hey, what happened? <span class="inlinedesc">[Looks around.]</span> Oh, it&#8217;s you. Hey, nice to see you again.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Indian Chief:</strong> We caught two of the men you requested to hunt down, and we are going to execute them.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> Good work. <span class="inlinedesc">[Approaches Roark and Keating.]</span> So, here you are.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Keating:</strong> Yes, Gail. Here we are.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Whispering]</span> You know, I can set you free and get it over with, right now.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Roark:</strong> No thanks, Gail. We are not the kind of men to quit a challenge like that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> Suit yourselves. <span class="inlinedesc">[To the chief]</span> You can proceed.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ An Indian approaches Roark, and cuts down his ropes. After he&#8217;s untied, Roark grabs the Indian&#8217;s knife, rushes toward Wynand, take hold of him and holds the knife close to his throat. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Roark:</strong> Untie Peter, and let the three of us escape, or else Wynand gets it!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Wynand:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[To Roark]</span> nice move.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Roark:</strong> Thanks.</p></div></section></main>
