Catherine Halsey, Peter&#8217;s valentine for many years, who had just lost her mother, was moving to reside with her uncle. The latter was Ellsworth Toohey, a creepy academic and journalist of the so-called &#8220;humanitarian&#8221; kind.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The door is ringing.
