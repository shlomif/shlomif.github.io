However, after Roark and Cameron had a long fight of whether the steps of a certain house should be white or light beige, Peter suggested that they all go separate ways. Thus, Roark quit to open his own office, while Peter started his own public relations company and is now regarded as the father of American publicists. <span class="inlinedesc">[During this speech there are various slides: Cameron, Roark and Keating smiling; Roark and Cameron fighting while Peter tries to calm them down; a photo of the Keating Foundation.]</span></p></div></section></main>
