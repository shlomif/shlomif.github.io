There&#8217;s a machine looking like a replicator nearby. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Yeah, I&#8217;m thirsty. <span class="inlinedesc">[Goes to the replicator]</span></p><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[To the replicator]</span> Orange juice.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ A cup of Orange Juice materialises. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Pink lemonade. <span class="inlinedesc">[Ditto]</span></p></div><div class="description"><p>[ They drink. The other people order. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Emmm&#8230; this tastes delicious. It&#8217;s like real lemonade. Much better than a replicator.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s really good.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> Well, technically these are real juices. This replicator is based on a transporter&#8217;s principle. We take an actual cup of juice, store it, and duplicate it precisely.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Odo:</strong> But isn&#8217;t it kinda wasteful?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> Possibly, but the Q Continuum can afford this waste in its current form.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mantoleer:</strong> The funny thing is that some Qs insist on growing their own food claiming it tastes better or because they enjoy it. I admit sometimes the dinners they give with this food are exceptionally delicious, but it may be a psychological effect.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Heh. <span class="inlinedesc">[sips on her drink]</span></p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Someone enters. He looks in his 50s and wears a cotton sweater with the words &#8220;Q GADOL&#8221; embroidered on it. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Hi!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> Hello, Q Gadol. Meet Katie, Jake, Odo, and you already know George and Mantoleer.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Q Gadol? &#8220;Q is big?&#8221;, &#8220;Q the big?&#8221;, reminds me of what that child said about &#8220;Q&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Yes, I was the child, hence my name.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> But you look older than Q, and Q is older.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> By 30 years or so, yes. Anyway, I feel a bit more mature so I&#8217;ve made a choice to look older.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> So can one or cannot one judge a book by its cover?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Depends how well your book cover intuition is.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> I&#8217;m glad to finally meet you, Jake. I&#8217;ve been a fan of your stories lately.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Don&#8217;t they rock?! I wish I could write like that. <span class="inlinedesc">[She kisses Jake on the cheek.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Jake seems content and smiles stupidly.]</span> Katie, have you tried starting from telling about your real-life? I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of stuff that have been happening to you on the OTF-1.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Well, I may have lied when I said that it was so exciting. Most of the time, they just hire us to protect shipments, or patrol some operation, and nothing ever happens. But we&#8217;re still needed in case something does. And being a system administrator-slash-programmer who&#8217;s not even a fighter is not exactly exciting either.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Yes, but I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll have plenty to write about. Maybe stories from your childhood, or from college.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Maybe&#8230; But enough about boring ol&#8217; twenty-something-old&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> And looking much younger&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Amused.]</span> OK, like I said let&#8217;s hear it from the ancient one.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Well, I don&#8217;t suppose my whereabouts a milliard years ago would be of much interest or relevancy for today. But I can tell you of my adventures as a German scholar on Earth.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> German? You?! What prompted you to become German?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Oh, just a weird fascination with the language and culture. The Germans are a pretty good lot. I met all the great German-speaking physicists and mathematicians and Bible researchers and what not. Back before World War II, German universities were the best in the world, and I enjoyed this fact.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> World war II&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Yes, what devastated Germany for many years.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> But Germany was hardly affected by it.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Not true. See, Hitler hated his own people just as much as he hated Jews or whoever he projected as the enemy-du-jour for people to be willing to commit their inhuman (if that&#8217;s the word) acts.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> See, the Third Law of Motion applies to human actions too: every action either benefits you and society at large, or it harms both of you. Hitler was not a bad person at first - maybe he was a little anti-Semitic, but that&#8217;s not enough to make you bad.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Reportedly all the greatest gentiles were antisemites <span class="inlinedesc">[Giggles]</span>.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Well, not all, but it&#8217;s been a trend. Anyway, evil is an addiction, and Hitler became addicted to it. And like Pharaoh in the book of Exodus he wouldn&#8217;t give up even if it was too late. He ended up dead in his bunker.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> We humanoids, or <span class="inlinedesc">[looking at George]</span> super-intelligent cats, or whatever, must fight Evil from within and without. We can never be completely benevolent. But like being honest, or being objective, or many other good traits, we must always strive to make the deviations as isolated as possible and to learn from our mistakes. Because when giving in to lying, dishonesty, subjectivity or mysticism, lies the road to disaster.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Katie is in tears. Cut. ]</p></div></section></main>
