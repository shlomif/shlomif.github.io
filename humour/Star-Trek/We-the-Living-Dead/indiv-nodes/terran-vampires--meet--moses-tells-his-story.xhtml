So what really happened?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Sure. See, it was at the time that my brother Aharon and I led a small tribe of Hebrew speaking nomads called the Levi&#8217;im. We ended up being captured by the Egyptians and forced to work at mines. However, we had a lot of communication problems. To facilitate this, I decided to teach everybody there the Phoenician alphabet.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> They liked it so much that they kept passing lots of written messages among themselves. Like a primitive form of instant messaging. Next thing I knew, all the Levi&#8217;im gained consciousness, conspired against their enslavers, and broke free. The Egyptians did not know what hit them.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> They called themselves &#8220;Bney Ha-Elohim&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> The sons of the gods!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Well, actually in ancient Hebrew, &#8220;Elohim&#8221; was a high leader. What Bney Ha-Elohim probably meant was that they were &#8220;self-leading&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Indeed. I still believed that we should behave ourselves morally, and with the help of Aharon, who acted as my spokesperson, due to the fact that I lacked assertiveness, we wandered around the desert. We eventually found another small tribe of Hebrew Semitic people (about 500) who called themselves &#8220;Bney Yisra&#8217;el&#8221;. I taught them the Alphabet, gave them the Ten Commandments, and instructed them to &#8220;invade&#8221; Canaan and convert the Canaanites to the one true way.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> It was Joshua, Kalev and other leaders of the Yisra&#8217;elim who did it. I myself followed my brother&#8217;s trail to Assyria, to see what he&#8217;s been up to. Back in Assyria, consciousness already started to take off. People were looking for gods, some people were still hallucinating them, there was deceit, there was uncertainty - it was a crazy place.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> I sat together with Aharon, as well as Nimrod, an early discoverer of consciousness, who &#8220;betrayed the gods&#8221; and escaped from death. We discussed the implications of the self-leading, and what it would lead to. We decided that the 3 of us will form a secret conspiracy, in order to further lead the world into prosperity and peace and by following the gods.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> So we travelled back to Israel. The &#8220;conquest&#8221; of Joshua was very successful, and we decided to party. However, a strange and majestic man came to us. He said he was a leader of leaders, a king of kings, a god of gods, and that we appeased him and said that he condemned us to roam the land forever, alive.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> Q!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> No, not Q himself, but one of the Qs. At the time, we felt it was indeed a curse, because we felt our death was the natural way. But it may also have been a blessing.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> In any case, you can imagine my surprise when the Israelites came here and asked me if I was willing to become an Israelite. The conversation was very funny. I asked them what would being an Israelite entail, and why it was important. Eventually, they decided I was too smart for them, and called upon Joshua. He decided that I was all-right, and that he wouldn&#8217;t mind having me here. So I stayed here as one of the Israelite&#8217;s leaders.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Judaism continued to evolve after what I told them. See, I gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments, which were an early, and not a very good, attempt at making a constitution. But they had their own regulations, and they accumulated more as time went by. By the time the Babylonian exile ended, the Jews had over 600 individual regulations. And this was only the start, as Jewish scholars were obsessed with making Jewish life even harder.</p></div></section></main>
