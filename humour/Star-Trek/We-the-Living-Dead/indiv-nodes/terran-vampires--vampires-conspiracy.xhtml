The vampires and immortals still kept their conspiracy. The leaders had a grand meeting every 40 years or so, and we communicated using cryptic messages we sent. We had been utilising several common fictitious themes for that. The first was the Occult, and somewhat later we also passed many messages in what seemed to be anti-Semitic material.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">the Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> were you?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Indeed. It was us. It was a piece of writing written by the Illuminati originally in German, which just emulated an anti-Semitic work, so it can be easily dismissed as such.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> World War II (initiated by real anti-Semites), placed a stop to us using the anti-Semitic theme. However, by that time we were already making use of various items of popular culture to pass our messages.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Shlomo:</strong> The funny thing was that some of our message conduits, became very successful commercially. Moreover, many writings and other works, which were written by people who were not interns to our culture, were often mistaken to be &#8220;Vampire-art&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> I still think you people suck.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Shlomo:</strong> Katie, I wish we didn&#8217;t.</p></div></section></main>
