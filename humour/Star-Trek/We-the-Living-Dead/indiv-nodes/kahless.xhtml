Kahless the Unforgettable - ready or not - here we come!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Avigayil:</strong> Sure thing, here we go.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The Scene gradually changes to a large hall where Kahless is standing. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> Worf! <span class="inlinedesc">[he laughs]</span> We meet again, finally. Reaches to hug him.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Worf hugs him while smiling in a fake manner. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> So you did appear during my vision.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> In a way. See: I kept an eye on you for a while when you were younger, and when I asked the Q Continuum for a favour to appear in your vision at when the time was right. So I appeared there in my living dead form with help from one of the Q&#8217;s here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> So you are still alive flesh and blood.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> Indeed. Alive and kicking.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Mr. Kahless, I&#8217;ve heard so much about you and I&#8217;m a big fan. Did everything that they said about your competency as a warrior is true?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> Hardly. See, my image was greatly exaggerated after my death. As good a fighter as I had been, I lost some exercise battles even at my prime, and could never successfully physically fight against entire armies of capable fighters. No one could.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> &#8220;Physically&#8221;?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> Indeed. Some time after my death, the noble Klingon fighting tradition has somewhat deteriorated into only considering Batelath fight or similar combat using weapons. But I possessed a far different and far more effective weapon - my words and deeds.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> you see: I was able to convince people; to compromise with them; even to become convinced. And we would spare the bloodshed, and would both win.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> the Living Dead Klingons have little use for hurting ourselves physically, and instead we worked on advancing our technology, and reaching the other themed planets of the Q continuum in this galaxy. So for example, we made contact with the Planet of the Hebrews, the Planet of the Celts, and the Planet of the Greeks - all have some very awe-inspiring fighters.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> wow!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> hmm&#8230; this is one aspect of fighting that has eluded most modern day Klingons, and I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;ll appreciate me bringing this message from you.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[While busy panning the camera]</span> You can count on that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> That put aside, I was wondering&#8230; if&#8230; we&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> &#8230;Could fight?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> Ahmmm&#8230; yes.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Laughs]</span> Of course, I never object to a good fight, especially not when death is out of the question - which is the case now for me as a living dead.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Avigayil snaps her fingers, and two Batelaths appear next to Worf and to Kahless. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Avigayil:</strong> These Batelaths are according to your preferences.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Kahless and Worf pick them up and hold them, and they start fighting. The battle is fierce, but eventually Worf causes Kahless&#8217; Batelath to drop off his hands, pins Kahless, and looks angry.</p><p>Kahless laughs. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> I was the best fighter of my time, but Batelath fighting has progressed by leaps and bounds since my time, and you are simply a better fighter.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> Oh! And I&#8217;m a little out of shape. We don&#8217;t get a lot of motivation to fight using a Batelath here. We have much more worthy forms of fighting to do, as I have said.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Worf grins, laughs, drops his Batelath, helps Kahless get up, and they hug. ]</p></div></section></main>
