In fact, I became a vampire. The Q continuum had a rule that a vampire who survived for 300 years would become an immortal, who cannot be killed. It does not mean one cannot feel pain, or become injured or be subdued, but it&#8217;s still better than nothing.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Shlomo:</strong> What happened to my father (David) was that he was once walking in the street with a friend, when he got mugged and was stabbed to death. He claimed that it was not fair and that he should have become an immortal, but Q would not have it. So he ended up as a living dead over at the Planet of the Hebrews.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Shlomo:</strong> I, on the other hand, had the fortune not to be killed in my first 300 years, and so became an immortal.</p></div></section></main>
