Nasi, Rabbi, Rav, Emir&#8230; you name it - I had it. Just call me Shlomo.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> I see. Mr. Shlomo.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Men, I tell you! Overachievers, and always need to travel. I stayed most of the time here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> And you are?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> I&#8217;m Dvorah.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Dvorah the Prophet?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> In a sense. See, I&#8217;ve been conscious since I was a little girl, and never hallucinated voices like the Nevi&#8217;im did. I was just considered a prophet because I was deemed so wise. I was good at settling disputes and so decided to eventually settle here in the Yizra&#8217;el Valley under a Date Tree.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> I expected to die soon, but for some reason, I didn&#8217;t.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> So the story in the Bible is true?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Oh, that. See, the Israelites here were indeed under threat. So I decided to assign the task of fighting the Canaanite to Baraq, a young brat who was conscious and rebellious and gave me nothing but trouble, but that I knew was very smart and clever. He did pretty well on the task. Then we partied.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Baraq is now doing Archaeological work for the Q continuum in the Peach Seed Galaxy. Indiana Jones style. This kid could never remain quiet for long.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> And was the song yours?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Song, song. Ah yes. Yes, but it was a later addition. See, a few centuries later, some kids approached me asking for information about the battle so they could do a play about it. I told them all about it and then they said &#8220;That&#8217;s it?&#8221;.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> So we spent a day composing a song, and rehearsed it, and eventually it was recorded in the Bible after God knows how many transformations and rewrites. But otherwise I just stayed here.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Well, I fled to Judea after the Assyrian conquest, and left with the Judeans to Babylon. Then I returned here, and saw that my Date tree was cut down. I eventually said &#8220;whatever&#8221; and settled near here ever since.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> Wow!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Dvorah, BTW, is considered the Terran elder, and thus is the ambassador of Earth in the Q continuum.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Yeah well, I was appointed as such because I was older than Mosheh here, but I wasn&#8217;t really the oldest living human. In fact, there are four women and two men who are older than me and still alive.</p></div></section></main>
