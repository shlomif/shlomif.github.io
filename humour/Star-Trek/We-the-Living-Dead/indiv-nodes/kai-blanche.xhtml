Kira is there looking bored. ]</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The door opens. Kai Blanch&#233; - a Bajoran, looking in his 50s enters, wearing traditional Vaedek clothes. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Looking]</span> Hello!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Hi! You must be Narris Kira. I am Alesodro Blanch&#233;. I&#8217;m a great fan of yours.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> Alesodro Blanch&#233;? Kai Blanch&#233;? One of the first Kais? But you&#8217;ve been dead for&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Millenia, yes. Well, I didn&#8217;t actually die. In fact I&#8217;ve become a vampire.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> A vampire? A Bajoran vampire?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Indeed.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> And you&#8217;re a fan of me? How is it possible? You&#8217;re still considered one of our best Kais. And a genius. And&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Well, everyone gets to pick his heroes.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> If I may interrupt this discussion, I&#8217;d like to film it. An old Bajoran Kai is always good for business.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> Quark, but the Bajorans are poor!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> True, but the industry around the Bajoran prophecies is making millions. People bet on it like crazy on Ferenginar and other planets.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> And might I add that Bajor sees very little of all this money.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> It&#8217;s not my fault that you don&#8217;t seem to care enough for making a profit out of this. In any case, let the camera roll.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> Go on, don&#8217;t mind me.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Fine by me. I&#8217;m sick of being presumed dead and could use some publicity.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Joins]</span> Sorry for being so ignorant, but what are you so famous for?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Well, following a few prophecies and some interpretations of them, I began to investigate games. My collaborators and I started to analyse them mathematically and create as many different variants of games, puzzles, riddles and other diversions as we could think of. I grew a substantial cult (well sort-of) collectively known as &#8220;Vedek Blanch&#233;&#8221; that worked on it, and we started developing what is now known as &#8220;Computer Science&#8221; - algorithms, proofs of correctness, Turing models, etc.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Wow, did you have computers at the time?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> We didn&#8217;t really as a matter of fact. Our enthusiasm actually prompted the Bajorans to investigate ways to realise these things. By the time my first cadence was terminated, we already had electronic computers.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> I must say I was never very enthusiastic about the cult surrounding me and how I got most of the credit. After my ascension to a vampire, I got so tired of Maths and Computer Science that I spent my next life as a simple farmer. Nowadays, I mostly travel around our original Galaxy and other galaxies as I see fit as a Q.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Interesting. By the way, isn&#8217;t Blanch&#233; a French name?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Indeed, I adopted this name after the name that the prophets told to be of one our gods, who turned out to be a Terran.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Amused]</span> Gods!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> Well, the Bajoran religion is unusual in that our supreme beings are the Prophets, who in turn assign &#8220;gods&#8221;, who are lesser and not omnipotent. As such Bajor has become known as &#8220;The Stock Exchange of the Gods&#8221;.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> We sometimes prefer calling these entities &#8220;Profiles&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Indeed. I should note that after communicating with the Prophets enough (we Qs don&#8217;t need the proximity to the wormhole, or the orbs) it&#8217;s become more of a hobby and an obsession than a faith to me. I kinda started to think of the prophets as my friends.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> What about The Emissary?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Oh he&#8217;s a god all-right, one of our most important ones, but by no means the only one. Our most famous profile was The Invisible. See, we believed we would never know who he was. But we did here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> Really, who?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Laughs]</span> I&#8217;ll give you one guess.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Kira, Bashir and Dax think for a while; meanwhile Q smiles a big, stupid, smile; then they look in Q&#8217;s direction. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> is it Q?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> I&#8217;m indeed The Invisible and proud of it. It&#8217;s so flattering being the most famous Bajoran god. And I feel like I deserve it.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> And I&#8217;m glad to see it didn&#8217;t go to your head.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> This is great stuff.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> Naturally there&#8217;s a huge problem unifying profiles as time progresses. At ancient times we had very pictorial names such as &#8220;The One who stands at the top of the Tower&#8221; or &#8220;The Wandering Son of the Lion&#8221;. As Bajoran mentality advanced, they became &#8220;The Front-End&#8221; and &#8220;The Wandering Jew&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Heh, cool. But really, what is the Invisible famous for?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanch&#233;:</strong> For example, he is the one who suggested Artaxerxes to bring Vashti to the guests. <span class="inlinedesc">[<a href="https://shlomif.livejournal.com/62243.html">Reference</a>]</span>.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Seriously? How come he interfered so much with the Earth&#8217;s population? Doesn&#8217;t the Q continuum know better than that.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Q laughs. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Amanda:</strong> See Doctor, the Q Continuum doesn&#8217;t have the Federation&#8217;s constitutional disapproval of interfering with less advanced civilisations.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Interesting. I suppose the Federation would appear primitive to the Q Continuum too.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Quite so, Doctor.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Amanda:</strong> Yes, and well, Q is a force of nature. He tends to perform some very unorthodox actions that even most Qs tend not to do, and yet they seem to turn out for the best in the end. No one knows how it works, but it does.</p></div></section></main>
