He was a quirky, paranoid fellow. At one point he sensed a storm coming, and believed that the world was coming to an end. So he, his wife, his sons, and all of his livestock travelled up a nearby mountain, and waited for the storm to end. <span class="inlinedesc">[Pictures are shown]</span></p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> When the storm ended, he went down to the nearby village, and saw that while there was a lot of damage, the people there were perfectly fine. However, he claimed that it was high time to put an end to such problems, to end having to depend on natural whims, that our society will flourish.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> I was there: my name was indeed &#8220;Que&#8221; and I was considered a strange nomad, who just happened to be around.

So what really happened?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Sure. See, it was at the time that my brother Aharon and I led a small tribe of Hebrew speaking nomads called the Levi&#8217;im. We ended up being captured by the Egyptians and forced to work at mines. However, we had a lot of communication problems. To facilitate this, I decided to teach everybody there the Phoenician alphabet.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> They liked it so much that they kept passing lots of written messages among themselves. Like a primitive form of instant messaging. Next thing I knew, all the Levi&#8217;im gained consciousness, conspired against their enslavers, and broke free. The Egyptians did not know what hit them.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> They called themselves &#8220;Bney Ha-Elohim&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> The sons of the gods!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Well, actually in ancient Hebrew, &#8220;Elohim&#8221; was a high leader. What Bney Ha-Elohim probably meant was that they were &#8220;self-leading&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Indeed. I still believed that we should behave ourselves morally, and with the help of Aharon, who acted as my spokesperson, due to the fact that I lacked assertiveness, we wandered around the desert. We eventually found another small tribe of Hebrew Semitic people (about 500) who called themselves &#8220;Bney Yisra&#8217;el&#8221;. I taught them the Alphabet, gave them the Ten Commandments, and instructed them to &#8220;invade&#8221; Canaan and convert the Canaanites to the one true way.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> It was Joshua, Kalev and other leaders of the Yisra&#8217;elim who did it. I myself followed my brother&#8217;s trail to Assyria, to see what he&#8217;s been up to. Back in Assyria, consciousness already started to take off. People were looking for gods, some people were still hallucinating them, there was deceit, there was uncertainty - it was a crazy place.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> I sat together with Aharon, as well as Nimrod, an early discoverer of consciousness, who &#8220;betrayed the gods&#8221; and escaped from death. We discussed the implications of the self-leading, and what it would lead to. We decided that the 3 of us will form a secret conspiracy, in order to further lead the world into prosperity and peace and by following the gods.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> So we travelled back to Israel. The &#8220;conquest&#8221; of Joshua was very successful, and we decided to party. However, a strange and majestic man came to us. He said he was a leader of leaders, a king of kings, a god of gods, and that we appeased him and said that he condemned us to roam the land forever, alive.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> Q!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> No, not Q himself, but one of the Qs. At the time, we felt it was indeed a curse, because we felt our death was the natural way. But it may also have been a blessing.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> In any case, you can imagine my surprise when the Israelites came here and asked me if I was willing to become an Israelite. The conversation was very funny. I asked them what would being an Israelite entail, and why it was important. Eventually, they decided I was too smart for them, and called upon Joshua. He decided that I was all-right, and that he wouldn&#8217;t mind having me here. So I stayed here as one of the Israelite&#8217;s leaders.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Judaism continued to evolve after what I told them. See, I gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments, which were an early, and not a very good, attempt at making a constitution. But they had their own regulations, and they accumulated more as time went by. By the time the Babylonian exile ended, the Jews had over 600 individual regulations. And this was only the start, as Jewish scholars were obsessed with making Jewish life even harder.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-terran-vampires--meet--shlomo-tells-his-story"><header><h5 id="terran-vampires--meet--shlomo-tells-his-story">Shlomo tells his story</h5></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Shlomo:</strong> In any case, I met Mosheh and my father shortly after my apparent-death.

I still remember my excitement with my first grandchild, and my first great-grandchild, but I didn&#8217;t know my 10th-level descendent was born until a long time after that.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Naturally, I could not come to her and say &#8220;Hi!

There are many great men of this galaxy&#8217;s past and good men of my past that I&#8217;d like to meet.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Well, you can now.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Assuming I trust you.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Well, you cannot really.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Right.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Sisko goes to look at space. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Tell me, Q, what was your secret sauce? How did the Q Continuum become as powerful as it is?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> It&#8217;s very simple, Captain. See, I was the first great man to realise that not only should I be unstoppable, not only should not allow myself to be put down, but that others are expected to become the same. The other Qs and the other &#201;nglishtants, emulated me, and competed with me, and were not really ruled by me.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> You may recall The Symbul. She still lives in our home planet surrounded by fields of crops and many volunteers who come to learn from her. She distrusts most of our modern technology, and there are many jokes about her, and by her about herself. Yet, she is one of our most influential leaders, because she too is a Q.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Being a Q is not something that is beyond your reach as a civilisation, Captain. You too can become a Q and so can everyone you encounter. The only thing you will gain from visiting the Q star system, is some insights into what past Qs have already achieved, and some of our higher superpowers.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> So you mean the holy grail was right at our reach all the time? That it was inside us?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Indeed. Your civilisation can also ascend into being Qs. Even without the Q continuum&#8217;s help.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Thank you.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ They shake hands. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> I&#8217;ll leave you now. I&#8217;d like to make it to Dvorah&#8217;s talk at Quark&#8217;s, should be quite interesting.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Have fun.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Farewell, Captain.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Farewell, Q, and thanks for everything.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> You&#8217;re welcome.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Q exits through the door. Sisko continues to watch space, thinking. ]</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ END. ]</p></div></section></section></main>
