Well, most of the Nazi big wigs ended up dead or persecuted to death after the Nuremberg Trials, so Q waited until they were all there. He then got me to lecture to them and determine their collective fate.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> I told them, in German: &#8220;You may have considered yourself an empire. But you were the empire of evil. And evil is nothing but laziness, irrationality, and self-destruction.&#8221; Then I gave them some more lecturing about the action and reaction law of human relations, and their self-created realities, and how they were misleading themselves and became addicted to mysticism and all of its bad manifestations.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Finally, I told Q to displace them to a Galaxy with relatively hostile conditions, in order to punish them.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> So you didn&#8217;t kill them?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> As a matter of fact, no. It is a policy of the Q Continuum and similar continuums to never kill any conscious individual.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> So what happened to them?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> They established the so-called &#8220;Empire of Evil&#8221;. And they are an Empire. They now control 14 home star systems. It was actually a useful shake to that Galaxy.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> And are they evil?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Nah, not at all. It&#8217;s just part of their image.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Huh, these days you find it harder to tell evil from non-evil.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q Gadol:</strong> Well, a good rule of a thumb is that evil corpora don&#8217;t admit they are evil, so if someone says he is, then he isn&#8217;t.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">George:</strong> For instance, I&#8217;m an evil cat.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Katie pats him affectionately. George purrs. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Odo:</strong> Speaking of evil, by the way, may I be prudent enough to ask what the Q Continuum knows of the origin of the changelings and the founders?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> Sure. See, the technology of the self-changing lifeforms was actually artificially created, and not by the founders. It was an Iconian innovation developed by some of their best biologists, who left remnants of it on the changelings&#8217; home planet.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Why did they abandon it?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> Well, they realised it was an unnatural and inconvenient life-form that left the mind in a crazy state, longing for being a &#8220;solid&#8221;.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Odo:</strong> I can attest it. I am much happier now as a solid than I was as a liquid. As a liquid, I wasn&#8217;t aware of all the great things I&#8217;ve missed.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> Indeed. In any case, many years later, a group of humanoid biologists from nearby planets investigated the technology and were able to apply it to themselves. They were so happy that they could change their form that they ended up as changelings, and ended up as this race with their origins lost in history.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> From there to establishing the dominion was a short step.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> By the way, what happened to the Iconians?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> Oh? Nothing really - they ascended into the Q Continuum. They left their gateways scattered around the galaxy, in hope that the future races will be able to visit other races and learn about them. However, with the contemporary climate of our galaxy, most of them were destroyed out of being considered security breaches.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> One can think it was na&#239;ve of them.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Pleena:</strong> Well, some people would rather err on na&#239;vety than on cynicism.</p></div></section></main>
