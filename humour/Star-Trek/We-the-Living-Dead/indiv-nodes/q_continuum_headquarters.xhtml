Yes, everyone&#8217;s here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> OK - please don&#8217;t be alarmed as the surroundings changes incrementally. It&#8217;s a trick we do to make the teleportation transition easier to fathom.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Roger.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The surroundings morph and eventually change to a well-lit large room. There&#8217;s a large window to the left. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> So I presume that&#8217;s part of the Q Continuum headquarters? According to this tricorder we seem to be on a completely different galaxy. A different galaxy cluster even.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Katie, Jake and other people approach the window ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Wow! It&#8217;s beautiful.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ View of the Q Continuum planet - there are several tall white buildings none of which obscure the views. They are shaped like a trumpet, and there are robots going up and down their tall parts.</p><p>There is a lot of trees and forests intermingled. There are large roads made of very clean stone, with some alien life forms, mostly resembling mammals walking in between them. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Not enthusiastically]</span> Impressive, I say.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> Quite lovely.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Well back to our business. Is there anything we&#8217;re looking here?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Sure. Amanda, please come here.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Amanda from <a href="http://sttng.epguides.info/?ID=306">The True Q Episode</a> enters through a door. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Amanda:</strong> Greetings people.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Wait a second - she looks like&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Yes, you&#8217;re the honour student that was identified as a Q on a USS Enterprise mission.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Amanda:</strong> That is indeed the case. As you see my parents - both human - had to return to the Q Continuum and decided to leave me on Earth (as a normal human baby) because some of their Terran friends became attached to me.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> And I suppose your parents missed you?</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ 1st level Q: A conscious organism.<br/>2nd level Q: A vampire - capable of living forever.<br/>3rd level Q: An immortal - cannot be killed.<br/>4th level Q: Capable of teleporting within the same planet.<br/>5th level Q: Capable of any teleportation.<br/>6th level Q: Capable of teleporting himself and others. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Amanda:</strong> That too, and they decided to meet me. So I was temporarily EnQed to a very high Q level, and then decided to come here. I met my parents and decided to start my road as a &#8220;Q&#8221; here. Right now, I&#8217;m a sixth level Q, and trying to slowly become more confident in not abusing my powers. Great power requires great responsibility.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Sixth level Q?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Amanda:</strong> Yep. A Q that is capable of teleporting himself and others.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> I see. What&#8217;s a first-level Q?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> A first level Q is any conscious organism. A second level Q is a &#8220;vampire&#8221; - an organism that doesn&#8217;t die. A third level Q is an &#8220;immortal&#8221; - an organism that cannot be killed.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Ah hah.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> And what about that woman of the humanoid master-race (the &#201;nglishtants, I presume) told us about the master race dying and all?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Oh that. That was The Symbul <span class="inlinedesc">[pronounced &#8220;T&#233; Symbul&#8221;]</span>&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> The Symbul, wait a second! <span class="inlinedesc">[checks her laptop]</span>. Hmmm&#8230; a very powerful sorceress in the Forgotten Realms world; an omni-potent goddess in the Plarian mythology; and the list goes on.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> So she is one of your most powerful Qs?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> The Symbul? Hardly! She is in fact an old technophobe that after all the milliards of years is still only a 3rd level Q, and relies on us for transportation. She&#8217;s a bit unhappy from always being considered a practically omni-potent being.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> In any case, she is considered the oldest &#201;nglishtant (not quite accurate, but still), and has been the &#8220;T&#8221; in our alphabet. Displaying that message around the galaxy was her idea. But it was a simplification.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Ah hah. By the way, Q2, I would be interested to know what was your original life-form like?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> You can certainly know. Look here <span class="inlinedesc">[points to a screen]</span>.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The screen shows a large number of Opossum-like creatures on a Jungle-like surrounding, eventually going to a city. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> An opossum?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> Indeed. I still miss it in a way. Giving birth as &#8220;an opossum&#8221; is very painless. In my human form, after the third time I gave birth, I couldn&#8217;t take it any-more and instead used artificial pregnancies.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Wow! I think I know what to do to implement exactly that&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> That&#8217;s enough, Doctor.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Don&#8217;t be too uptight, Commander.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> That&#8217;s OK.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> In any case, I&#8217;ll leave you kids for now.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Are you too busy?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> No. Busy people are unproductive. We are very productive and so we&#8217;re almost never busy. But I need some rest, and think I&#8217;m no longer needed here. Q can always find me, anyway.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Sure.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> Meanwhile, you&#8217;ll probably want to meet the living dead. <span class="inlinedesc">[she leaves through the door]</span>.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> The what?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> The living dead. People whom you believed to be dead, while in fact being relocated to a different galaxy, fully living there. Is there anyone specific you&#8217;d like to meet?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Can I go first? <span class="inlinedesc">[enthusiastically]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> Miss Jacobson&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Sure you can, Katie!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Worf seems unamused. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> I&#8217;d like to meet the big 20th-21st century UNIX hackers. You know, Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Linus <span class="inlinedesc">[= Lee-nos]</span> Torvalds, Richard Stallman, Larry Wall - the works.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> That is doable. Is it OK with you people?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> I suppose.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> And I smell a huge business potential for a movie with them featured in.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Amanda:</strong> Done then, let&#8217;s go.</p></div></section></main>
