We sent delegates to other villages and countries bringing the news of the Alphabet and all our other discoveries and decisions. Eventually, I found the &#201;nglish pronunciation too tedious, so I asked people to make a better one. And someone came up with modern English.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Heh.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> We advanced quickly. A year later we already had steam. We discovered our planet was round, and circled the globe within 10 years. We defined a constitution, and founded mass-production and the free market. I kept asking for more and more challenges to accomplish. Here is what happened after 40 years:</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The holodeck shows Q standing on the hill where he had given the speech holding a flag. There&#8217;s a large crowd and many cameras are visible. He then moves to the right and sticks the flag somewhere else. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Vision Q:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[In modern English]</span> Vampires of the world - we are united! 40 years ago I stood there <span class="inlinedesc">[points to the top of the hill]</span> and decided to form an encompassing civilisation for our entire planet. Today, I can say we have been successful.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Vision Q:</strong> We&#8217;ve already been gradually extending our lives by large increments. But it will be nice to find a way to remain young forever. So this is the next Q task. And another one is to conquer the stars. So go to work! <span class="inlinedesc">[The crowd cheers]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Holodeck Q:</strong> We conquered the stars and spread across the galaxy. Within 400 years, we encircled the galaxy in one go using this ship <span class="inlinedesc">[Shown a very old and antiquated ship]</span>.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> Isn&#8217;t she a beauty?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> At that point we were approached by the Alpha Continuum. They sent Q2 here <span class="inlinedesc">[Q2 blushes]</span> to greet us.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> I&#8217;ll take it from here. It took the &#201;nglishtants 400 years from the invention of the Alphabet till the circling of the Galaxy. 400 years for a Carbon-based life-form was a record that was not broken ever or since. I informed Q that the Alpha Continuum provided the &#201;nglishtants with protection against pre-mature deaths, and gave other services that Continuums give.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> Q informed me that since his race had been so successful, he has decided to form their own Continuum - the Q Continuum. After some thinking, I told him that I would join the Q Continuum, as an act of appreciation for them being so competent and determined.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> So I understand that the Q Continuum is not the first Continuum to have been span-off the Alpha Continuum.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Not at all.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Q: so you&#8217;ve misled us to believe you were the most uncooperative being in existence, while in fact projecting the greatest cooperative project in the history of the universe?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Well, for some values of &#8220;greatest&#8221;. See: I used to be a simple common organism. But six and a half milliard years later and a lot of technological advancement have made me much less dependent on other people&#8217;s whims.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> I appear rather blas&#233; and always have been to some extent. But I still don&#8217;t wish to die now or never. Technology can give you many things, but we high-order Qs still find a lot of joy in a walk in the woods, or in tasty food, or in the little joys of life. We&#8217;re still human, after all.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> Wow!</p></div></section></main>
