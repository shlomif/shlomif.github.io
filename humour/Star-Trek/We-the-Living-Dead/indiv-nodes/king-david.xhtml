We could meet with famous Hebrews of the past.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Right, like King David. Oh, can we please meet him?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Ken Thompson:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Clicks a few keys.]</span> Dave, can you come here for a sec?</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The door opens and a moderately short man, looks in his thirties, appears. He has dark red hair, and a small beard. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> David Ben-Yishay. At your service.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Seriously?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> This is gonna make a wonderful story.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Cut. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Yes, I was King David.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Did you really kill Goliath?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Yes, I did. It was nothing really. We Semite shepherds were masters with the sling. I once hit a Lion at three times the distance, and frankly it was much more agile than the fully armoured Goliath and his pathetic shield-bearer.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Heh, nice. Are you still King here?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> That&#8217;s a long story. See, when the first conscious Hebrew speakers came here, we were told that this was the underworld. We thought, &#8220;Wow! What a nice underworld!&#8221;. So we just ate, drank, played games, made love, played music and stuff. But we got tired of that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> So what did you do?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> We got into philosophy and science. We actually started a short time before the Greek philosophy took off, but naturally, it then gave us a real boost. So we established universities and started studying and inventing stuff.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Since we were living dead, we were not influenced by the rise of Christianity and the middle ages, and just went on. As a result, we&#8217;re now even more advanced than Earth is, as ironic as it is. I became a scholar too.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> What did you specialise in?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> See, we don&#8217;t have that here. Each Scholar (which is our modern term for &#8220;philosopher&#8221;) studies various units of knowledge, and passes tests, and gets credit. But you can study anything you want in any field. The more units you have the more prestigious you are. I&#8217;ve contributed to my own share of inventions: the camera, the hyper-drive, a few programming languages, other stuff like that, and a lot of humane things.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Wow, cool.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Anyway, to me being king. Back when the Hebrew peoples came here, we didn&#8217;t see a point in appointing administration. It was just &#8220;live and let live&#8221; (well, we could no longer be killed) and &#8220;do and let do&#8221;. But as more and more dead Jews (and some dead Christians and Muslims) arrived here, they sort of wanted me to be king.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> So you became king?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Well, not at first. I objected to it. I had much better things to do than be king again. And naturally, the Edomis, the Phoenicians, the Moabites, and the others didn&#8217;t really want me as king either. But eventually, I was voted king and reluctantly became one. So now I&#8217;m a king. And a scholar.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[With the camera]</span> Wonderful, wonderful, I&#8217;m sure all those Terrans will pay mad coin to see this. Keep going.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Speaking of Terrans, I don&#8217;t suppose Jesus is here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> As a matter of fact he is. Let me summon him.</p></div></section></main>
