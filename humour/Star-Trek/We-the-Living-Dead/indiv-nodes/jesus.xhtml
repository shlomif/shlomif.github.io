At your service.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> So you&#8217;re real.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> Heh, most of what they tell about me in the New Testament was anything but real. My followers and I were mostly possessed or Schizophrenics. Arguably, the same thing could be said on the earlier Jewish prophets, but we uttered mostly complete non-sense.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Ah.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> In any case, regarding my death. I actually survived the cross, and was taken care of by a kind Jew. He nursed me and restored me to sanity. I decided to travel to Babylon where there was a prosperous Jewish community and where they were in much better shape than Judea at the time. So I did.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> There I learned to read and write, studied the Torah, and became a merchant. I died a grandfather and came here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> Wow!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> The whole old gang met here, and completely laughed at some of the non-senses we said. As it turned out Christianity actually started as a cult of Pagan Roman Priests, who only later adopted pseudo-Jewish beliefs as a way to battle the Jews, who met them with a lot of resistance.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> After Christianity took over, people here told me &#8220;Hey Josh, this is all your fault&#8221;. So they forced me into becoming their No. 1 expert of Christianity.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> Early Christianity was horrible. They considered pleasure the primary evil, and greatly oppressed women. Humans were considered to be very bad, and very evil. It took the world a lot of time to recover from it.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> Several Christian girls were intelligent and smart enough to see through the many logical fallacies of Christianity and to demonstrate how irrational and stupid it was. Even the Bishops and Archbishops were no match for them. So the Church retorted to burning them as witches. A lot of them arrived here as heroines.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Heh.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> Wow, excellent stuff. I&#8217;m going to make a fortune out of this movie.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Damn right you will. Speaking of Jesus and David, how about other famous Jews of the past? Moses? King Solomon?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Ahmm&#8230; they&#8217;re not here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> You mean - they were resurrected in a different planet?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> No, they didn&#8217;t die in the first place. They are vampires.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> Wow! A vampire is&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">David:</strong> Someone who doesn&#8217;t die.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jake:</strong> So they&#8217;re still on Earth.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Yes, they are. Do you want to go there now?</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ They all say &#8220;yes&#8221;. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> OK, let&#8217;s go.</p></div></section></main>
