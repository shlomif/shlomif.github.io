I have given Quark a holodeck module for a demonstration - nothing special about it. What you&#8217;re about to see happened in my race&#8217;s home planet over 6 milliard years ago. We just broke up from the reign of an empire called the &#8220;Ivrim&#8221;. They were not too good and not too bad. <span class="inlinedesc">[<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-fRo5-p9hE">Reference: Monty Python's Life of Brian - "What Have The Romans Ever Done For Us?"</a>]</span></p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> As such we adopted their language, only with many errors.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Modern Hebrew?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Precisely.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Anyway, we also had another language, universal on our continent which we called &#201;nglish. It was just like modern English only pronounced phonetically. Rather hideous. This language was considered holy - everyone knew it, but people were afraid to talk in it. It was reserved for the &#8220;perophets&#8221;, who were people who talked with the &#8220;Bey-de-jor-eans&#8221;, who were our gods.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> Hmmmpppfff&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Hmmpppf indeed. What is the reason for all these coincidences?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> The Universe is coincidental, Captain, for some reasons which even we don&#8217;t fully understand yet. And for the record, even we were preceded by different races of humanoids.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> I see. Go on.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> In any case, there was this relatively mature man in our time called No&#8217;ach who had three sons.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Shem, Cham and Yepheth? <span class="inlinedesc">[in Modern Hebrew pronunciation]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> You guessed it. He was a quirky, paranoid fellow. At one point he sensed a storm coming, and believed that the world was coming to an end. So he, his wife, his sons, and all of his livestock travelled up a nearby mountain, and waited for the storm to end. <span class="inlinedesc">[Pictures are shown]</span></p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> When the storm ended, he went down to the nearby village, and saw that while there was a lot of damage, the people there were perfectly fine. However, he claimed that it was high time to put an end to such problems, to end having to depend on natural whims, that our society will flourish.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> I was there: my name was indeed &#8220;Que&#8221; and I was considered a strange nomad, who just happened to be around. I decided to take upon myself the establishment of the <span class="inlinedesc">[in &#201;nglish]</span> &#8220;civilisation&#8221; instead of the many different <span class="inlinedesc">[in &#201;nglish]</span> &#8220;cultures&#8221;.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Now, there were many kids in the village who seemed to be amused by all that. One thing was that they often had trouble pronouncing Shem&#8217;s name with a &#8220;Sh&#8221; sound and instead used &#8220;S&#8221; - &#8220;Sem&#8221;. People found it annoying, but the children couldn&#8217;t care less.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Back then, writing systems were still hideously complex, and practically no one used them. So I told the kids to come up with a good writing system. They decided to collect 26 symbols of the signature signs of some people in the village, and figure out a way to write using it.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-Englishtant_kids_prez"><header><h4 id="Englishtant_kids_prez">The &#201;nglishtant Kids Presentation</h4></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Eventually they invited us all to a presentation.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The holodeck shows a long shot of an &#201;nglishtant field.

We sent delegates to other villages and countries bringing the news of the Alphabet and all our other discoveries and decisions. Eventually, I found the &#201;nglish pronunciation too tedious, so I asked people to make a better one. And someone came up with modern English.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Heh.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> We advanced quickly. A year later we already had steam. We discovered our planet was round, and circled the globe within 10 years. We defined a constitution, and founded mass-production and the free market. I kept asking for more and more challenges to accomplish. Here is what happened after 40 years:</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The holodeck shows Q standing on the hill where he had given the speech holding a flag. There&#8217;s a large crowd and many cameras are visible. He then moves to the right and sticks the flag somewhere else. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Vision Q:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[In modern English]</span> Vampires of the world - we are united! 40 years ago I stood there <span class="inlinedesc">[points to the top of the hill]</span> and decided to form an encompassing civilisation for our entire planet. Today, I can say we have been successful.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Vision Q:</strong> We&#8217;ve already been gradually extending our lives by large increments. But it will be nice to find a way to remain young forever. So this is the next Q task. And another one is to conquer the stars. So go to work! <span class="inlinedesc">[The crowd cheers]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Holodeck Q:</strong> We conquered the stars and spread across the galaxy. Within 400 years, we encircled the galaxy in one go using this ship <span class="inlinedesc">[Shown a very old and antiquated ship]</span>.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> Isn&#8217;t she a beauty?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> At that point we were approached by the Alpha Continuum. They sent Q2 here <span class="inlinedesc">[Q2 blushes]</span> to greet us.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> I&#8217;ll take it from here. It took the &#201;nglishtants 400 years from the invention of the Alphabet till the circling of the Galaxy. 400 years for a Carbon-based life-form was a record that was not broken ever or since. I informed Q that the Alpha Continuum provided the &#201;nglishtants with protection against pre-mature deaths, and gave other services that Continuums give.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q2:</strong> Q informed me that since his race had been so successful, he has decided to form their own Continuum - the Q Continuum. After some thinking, I told him that I would join the Q Continuum, as an act of appreciation for them being so competent and determined.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> So I understand that the Q Continuum is not the first Continuum to have been span-off the Alpha Continuum.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Not at all.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> I see.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Sisko:</strong> Q: so you&#8217;ve misled us to believe you were the most uncooperative being in existence, while in fact projecting the greatest cooperative project in the history of the universe?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> Well, for some values of &#8220;greatest&#8221;. See: I used to be a simple common organism. But six and a half milliard years later and a lot of technological advancement have made me much less dependent on other people&#8217;s whims.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Q:</strong> I appear rather blas&#233; and always have been to some extent. But I still don&#8217;t wish to die now or never. Technology can give you many things, but we high-order Qs still find a lot of joy in a walk in the woods, or in tasty food, or in the little joys of life.
