Just something that interests me: your love lives. As thousands-of-years-old. Gossip, please!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> Commander!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> Yes, honey? <span class="inlinedesc">[She approaches him and hugs him on the side.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Sighs]</span> Never mind!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Controlling the camera]</span> But I agree, sex sells! I&#8217;m sure people would love to hear about the love life of Mogless.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Moses.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> Yes, whatever.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> OK! <span class="inlinedesc">[laughs]</span> I&#8217;ll start. Well, I told you I married girls who were 40 times my younger and my own descendants. Well, back when we invaded Canaan women were treated as their husband&#8217;s property. Even the Hebrew word for husband is &#8220;owner&#8221; and the one for wife is &#8220;woman&#8221; until this very day.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Anyway, it took time for love to take hold after we became conscious. Not to mention that, as opposed to Greek, Israelis often considered it a nice optional bonus for marriage-life and not an absolute requirement.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> As such, I noticed that I could not&#8230; <span class="inlinedesc">[TODO - fill in.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> As for me - it&#8217;s very strange. I am known as a &#8220;man-killer&#8221; among the Terran vampires in the sense that I normally remain committed to a single husband in my lifetime, and we raise a family, but then I get tired of him, and he goes his own way (or dies, and getting taken care of by the Q Continuum).</p><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> And here&#8217;s another funny thing: I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times I lost and gained my period. It seems that I grow older and then suddenly become younger again. I cannot explain it. And naturally, in my age, it&#8217;s hard to tell my children (and descendants) the usual clich&#233;s of &#8220;When I was your age.&#8221;.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Moreover, some guys go to me when I look like I&#8217;m in my twenties, saying &#8220;Hey, you look seem like a nice chick&#8221;, and they would find it hard to believe that I&#8217;m old enough to be (and often am) their 10th or 20th-level or more ancestor.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> So what happened to all your previous husbands? And your children?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Heh, good question. I wish I could readily recall them all, but I can only remember ones that are mentioned to me. Enumerating them would be futile. Some of my husbands and children were or have become vampires - some of them are living elsewhere, and it&#8217;s naturally hard for me to tell who were my descendants and how, without querying the Q continuum database. I still remember my excitement with my first grandchild, and my first great-grandchild, but I didn&#8217;t know my 10th-level descendent was born until a long time after that.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> Naturally, I could not come to her and say &#8220;Hi! I&#8217;m your great-times-nine grandmother.&#8221; She wouldn&#8217;t have believed me for once, though now she does as a Q.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dax:</strong> I see.</p></div></section></main>
