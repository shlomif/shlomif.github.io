So they forced me into becoming their No. 1 expert of Christianity.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> Early Christianity was horrible. They considered pleasure the primary evil, and greatly oppressed women. Humans were considered to be very bad, and very evil. It took the world a lot of time to recover from it.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Jesus:</strong> Several Christian girls were intelligent and smart enough to see through the many logical fallacies of Christianity and to demonstrate how irrational and stupid it was.

So what really happened?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Sure. See, it was at the time that my brother Aharon and I led a small tribe of Hebrew speaking nomads called the Levi’im. We ended up being captured by the Egyptians and forced to work at mines. However, we had a lot of communication problems. To facilitate this, I decided to teach everybody there the Phoenician alphabet.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> They liked it so much that they kept passing lots of written messages among themselves. Like a primitive form of instant messaging. Next thing I knew, all the Levi’im gained consciousness, conspired against their enslavers, and broke free. The Egyptians did not know what hit them.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> They called themselves “Bney Ha-Elohim”.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> The sons of the gods!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Katie:</strong> Well, actually in ancient Hebrew, “Elohim” was a high leader. What Bney Ha-Elohim probably meant was that they were “self-leading”.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Indeed. I still believed that we should behave ourselves morally, and with the help of Aharon, who acted as my spokesperson, due to the fact that I lacked assertiveness, we wandered around the desert. We eventually found another small tribe of Hebrew Semitic people (about 500) who called themselves “Bney Yisra’el”. I taught them the Alphabet, gave them the Ten Commandments, and instructed them to “invade” Canaan and convert the Canaanites to the one true way.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> It was Joshua, Kalev and other leaders of the Yisra’elim who did it. I myself followed my brother’s trail to Assyria, to see what he’s been up to. Back in Assyria, consciousness already started to take off. People were looking for gods, some people were still hallucinating them, there was deceit, there was uncertainty - it was a crazy place.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> I sat together with Aharon, as well as Nimrod, an early discoverer of consciousness, who “betrayed the gods” and escaped from death. We discussed the implications of the self-leading, and what it would lead to. We decided that the 3 of us will form a secret conspiracy, in order to further lead the world into prosperity and peace and by following the gods.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> So we travelled back to Israel. The “conquest” of Joshua was very successful, and we decided to party. However, a strange and majestic man came to us. He said he was a leader of leaders, a king of kings, a god of gods, and that we appeased him and said that he condemned us to roam the land forever, alive.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kira:</strong> Q!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> No, not Q himself, but one of the Qs. At the time, we felt it was indeed a curse, because we felt our death was the natural way. But it may also have been a blessing.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dvorah:</strong> In any case, you can imagine my surprise when the Israelites came here and asked me if I was willing to become an Israelite. The conversation was very funny. I asked them what would being an Israelite entail, and why it was important. Eventually, they decided I was too smart for them, and called upon Joshua. He decided that I was all-right, and that he wouldn’t mind having me here. So I stayed here as one of the Israelite’s leaders.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Judaism continued to evolve after what I told them. See, I gave the Israelites the Ten Commandments, which were an early, and not a very good, attempt at making a constitution. But they had their own regulations, and they accumulated more as time went by. By the time the Babylonian exile ended, the Jews had over 600 individual regulations. And this was only the start, as Jewish scholars were obsessed with making Jewish life even harder.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-terran-vampires--meet--shlomo-tells-his-story"><header><h4 id="terran-vampires--meet--shlomo-tells-his-story">Shlomo tells his story</h4></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Shlomo:</strong> In any case, I met Mosheh and my father shortly after my apparent-death. In fact, I became a vampire. The Q continuum had a rule that a vampire who survived for 300 years would become an immortal, who cannot be killed. It does not mean one cannot feel pain, or become injured or be subdued, but it’s still better than nothing.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Shlomo:</strong> What happened to my father (David) was that he was once walking in the street with a friend, when he got mugged and was stabbed to death. He claimed that it was not fair and that he should have become an immortal, but Q would not have it. So he ended up as a living dead over at the Planet of the Hebrews.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Shlomo:</strong> I, on the other hand, had the fortune not to be killed in my first 300 years, and so became an immortal.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-terran-vampires--vampires-conspiracy"><header><h4 id="terran-vampires--vampires-conspiracy">The Vampires’ Conspiracy</h4></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Indeed. The vampires and immortals still kept their conspiracy. The leaders had a grand meeting every 40 years or so, and we communicated using cryptic messages we sent. We had been utilising several common fictitious themes for that. The first was the Occult, and somewhat later we also passed many messages in what seemed to be anti-Semitic material.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> So <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">the Protocols of the Elders of Zion</a> were you?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mosheh:</strong> Indeed.

My collaborators and I started to analyse them mathematically and create as many different variants of games, puzzles, riddles and other diversions as we could think of. I grew a substantial cult (well sort-of) collectively known as “Vedek Blanché” that worked on it, and we started developing what is now known as “Computer Science” - algorithms, proofs of correctness, Turing models, etc.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Bashir:</strong> Wow, did you have computers at the time?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kai Blanché:</strong> We didn’t really as a matter of fact.

And we would spare the bloodshed, and would both win.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> the Living Dead Klingons have little use for hurting ourselves physically, and instead we worked on advancing our technology, and reaching the other themed planets of the Q continuum in this galaxy. So for example, we made contact with the Planet of the Hebrews, the Planet of the Celts, and the Planet of the Greeks - all have some very awe-inspiring fighters.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Jadzia:</strong> wow!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> hmm… this is one aspect of fighting that has eluded most modern day Klingons, and I’m sure they’ll appreciate me bringing this message from you.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Quark:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[While busy panning the camera]</span> You can count on that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> That put aside, I was wondering… if… we…</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> …Could fight?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Worf:</strong> Ahmmm… yes.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Kahless:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[Laughs]</span> Of course, I never object to a good fight, especially not when death is out of the question - which is the case now for me as a living dead.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Avigayil snaps her fingers, and two Batelaths appear next to Worf and to Kahless. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Avigayil:</strong> These Batelaths are according to your preferences.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ Kahless and Worf pick them up and hold them, and they start fighting.
