The General is calmer and stopped crying. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> So what can you tell me about Ms. Gellar? Why do you think she is Satan?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> OK, it was the summer of 1997, the show <i class="italics">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i> started airing and was all the rage among young men, and Gellar, who starred in it, started her foray into the cinema in such films as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Know_What_You_Did_Last_Summer"><i class="italics">I Know What You Did Last Summer</i></a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scream_2"><i class="italics">Scream 2</i></a>, which were cheesy thrillers, and not too scary ones.</p><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Anyway, we invited several young people for internship during then, and due to the conditions here, it became a common adage among them that &#8220;If <i class="italics">Summerschool at the NSA</i> will be Sarah Michelle Gellar&#8217;s next film, it will be scary.&#8221;, or &#8220;<i class="italics">Summerschool at the NSA</i> may might as well be Sarah Michelle Gellar&#8217;s next movie&#8221;, and most interns left citing this. The years passed, Buffy remained popular, Gellar moved on to more acclaimed films, but it continued to haunt us.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> I see.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Eventually, the <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#smg_next_film">meme appeared on the Internet</a>, and drove us mad.</p><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> We decided to monitor Gellar, but she seemed to lead an ordinary life of filming, modelling, eating, training, sleeping, dating, socialising, etc. - nothing to be afraid of.</p><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> But today we were proven to be wrong.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Yes, you were.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> I have a question: what do you think you have done wrong in allowing such a huge breach of your organisation&#8217;s &#8220;security&#8221; by Sarah and I?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Heh, that&#8217;s a good question - I wish I knew.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Let me ask you this - do you think unhappy people can be secure?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[thinks for a moment.]</span> Definitely not. A miserable person always causes his downfall.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Well, were you happy or miserable.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Oh, we were miserable. I guess I forgot everything that I learned about <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</a>. Man, I remember being exalted after finishing to read his biography.</p><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> I forgot all about that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Yes, yes. Also, do you think keeping all the NSA&#8217;s secrets to yourself was a sound strategy.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> <span class="inlinedesc">[thinks for a moment]</span> &#8220;Publish or Perish&#8221;, ma&#8217;am. No way around it.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> OK, let me tell you all a secret: there&#8217;s more to being an action hero or an action heroine than what you see in films and on television. The &#8220;into the maelstrom&#8221; action there is good for business, and for captivating audiences, but not something a really good warrior will ever do. The first thing they tell us in self-defence classes is to always avoid a battle, because it is better to be poorer, or ridiculed, or saddened, or depressed, than it is to be dead or injured.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Saladin took a huge risk in liberating Palestine from the rule of the Knights Templar, but it had to be done, and he did it by being fair, and chivalrous and forgiving, and became an instant hero and a model for emulation for centuries.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Similarly, I took a huge risk by going in here, because it had to be done, as part of my responsibility for my country, and for the world, and for everybody. And I also handled it without bloodshed and with as little risk as possible, in a truly heroic fashion.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Yes, Ms. Glau.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Now, what do you say of us fighting a little for your own sake?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Fighting? How?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> General, are you married?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Yes, I still am. It&#8217;s been a long while since I spent a lot of time with my wife. She&#8217;s been E-mailing me a lot of stuff she found on Television and the Internet, and I didn&#8217;t have time to read, view or hear it all - I just replied to it laconically. I cannot believe how selfish I was.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Yes, do you still love her?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Oh, Ms. Glau! I do, but I wouldn&#8217;t blame her if she divorces me tomorrow - it may actually make her happier.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> OK, what do you say about preventing that? Maybe you and I shall take her on a date?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Really, Ms. Glau? You will do it for me? My wife will be delighted. Not sure Uncle Sam will let me get off so easily, though.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Maybe not Uncle Sam, but how about the Messiah? He&#8217;s even above the president.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> The Messiah? Who is he?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> I am. And you can be him too.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> Sounds crazy.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> It is and it&#8217;s a long story, but normal people are never fun.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> OK, fair enough. We&#8217;ll go on a date.</p><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> But first I want to call the president about cutting our budget, and, and, publishing everything we know, and&#8230;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> General, there will be time for that.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> OK, fair enough. Let me give you my house&#8217;s address. I know a great restaurant nearby which my wife and I used to love. She will love hearing all your stories.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> I sure hope so, General. There&#8217;s a lot I can tell.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander:</strong> We also need to call her.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ SGlau: stands up. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> OK, class dismissed. I&#8217;m leaving here some souvenirs - signed photographs and sets of translucent role playing games dice in various colours.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The crowd starts clapping for a standing ovation, and some people start whistling. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Thank you. <span class="inlinedesc">[She bows and goes to close the camera.]</span></p></div><div class="description"><p>[ On the camera screen: ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Mission accomplished. So long and thanks for all the fish.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ SGlau closes the camera. Cut.</p><p>END.</p><p>End music: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10PBekTNXoo">Caitlin Hart: &#8220;7 Minutes&#8221;</a>. ]</p></div></section></main>
