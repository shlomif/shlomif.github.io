OK, my talk today will be about lots of random stuff, but it should be a fun talk and you&#8217;ll see its theme soon enough.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-summer_glau_presents__the_talk__goliath"><header><h5 id="summer_glau_presents__the_talk__goliath">David and Goliath</h5></header><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Let&#8217;s start:&#8230; <span class="inlinedesc">[The screen shows a photo of David and Goliath.]</span></p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> yes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goliath">David and Goliath</a>.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> The Israelites and the Philistines schedule a large battle. The Philistines have far superior equipment with armours made out of iron, which the Israelites don&#8217;t have. Eventually, Goliath, a tall Philistine giant, steps forward and asks for an Israelite man worthy enough to fight him and determine the fate of the battle (something which was quite common in the ancient Near East). It seems the Israelites will lose the battle.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Out of nowhere, a young Israelite boy whom hardly anyone knew about steps forward with a sling and a few pebbles. Goliath thinks this is ridiculous and ridicules him. However, the boy quickly puts a pebble in his sling, and after rotating the sling to achieve a very large velocity (not unusual with slings) hurls the pebble with great accuracy (also not unthinkable, because shepherds in the Near East effectively used slings to kill lions and other predators to their flock) into Goliath&#8217;s face, which was uncovered to allow him to see. Even if Goliath&#8217;s shield bearer wanted to, he could not lift the huge shield in time, and Goliath was completely not agile in his suit and armour. The sling&#8217;s rock smashes Goliath&#8217;s brain, and he falls to the ground dead. The Israelites have won the battle.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> That boy&#8217;s name was David.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Why is it important here? Because David was a &#8220;hacker&#8221;, and I realise that that term possibly triggers a lot of fear here. Why was he a hacker? Because he knew the rules, and played by them, but knew how to bend them, in order to earn his victory. Hackers bend the rules.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> And here&#8217;s the thing: this is what an action hero is all about: he makes his own rules, even breaks them, and does not accept his fate. This is whereas a tragic hero is bound by many invisible rules, and accepts his fate, which is &#8212; almost certainly &#8212; death.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> And in real life, you should also aim to be a hacker, or an action hero, or the many phrases it used to be called.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ There&#8217;s some enthusiastic hand clapping from the audience. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Thank you. OK, let&#8217;s move on.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-summer_glau_presents__the_talk__two_guns"><header><h5 id="summer_glau_presents__the_talk__two_guns">A Gun in Each Hand</h5></header><div class="description"><p>[ Fade to black.

It was time consuming, but doable.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Whatever you do, you should realise to never shoot while you&#8217;re running. You only see it in movies, but in real life, it&#8217;s a spectacularly bad idea.</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-summer_glau_presents__the_talk__amateur_fighters"><header><h5 id="summer_glau_presents__the_talk__amateur_fighters">Amateur Fighters</h5></header><div class="description"><p>[ Fade to black. Cut. Fade in. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> In <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers">The Three Musketeers</a>, Dumas tells the story of how d&#8217;Artagnan who is a young swordsman without much of an official training, from a remote region of France, eventually becomes the best fighter in France. This is despite the fact that his peers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, have much more experience and training.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> It may seem farfetched, but before the industrialisation of the Far East, and the way the West interpreted martial arts, with the coloured belts and all, there were regional masters of these arts, who practised them as much as they could and honed their skills. However, despite all that, they never ruled out that they would one day fight against someone who never faught before, and lose.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> I can attest to it from my experience. I have been training in martial arts for years, and part of what I do is instruct kids in the martial arts. A lot of them seem happy to get a chance to fight against someone famous like me, and doing that in Southern California like that is good for the ego. <b class="bold">And:</b> it&#8217;s also good publicity. <span class="inlinedesc">[The Audience laughs.]</span></p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> Now, most kids just want to learn the moves and fight in the proper way, but there&#8217;s a minority of disobedient kids: they disrespect the rules, improvise moves, and they are strong and agile.</p><p><strong class="sayer">SGlau:</strong> And as surprising as it sounds, I have so far lost three rounds to such kids, all of them boys, despite my years of training and experience. I have yet to find a girl (probably a tomboy) who will achieve that, but I&#8217;m still hopeful that it will happen one day, heh. <span class="inlinedesc">[Claps from the audience]</span></p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The door opens. Voice from back of the camera - General Keith B. Alexander . ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">General Alexander&#8217;s Voice:</strong> Hey, what&#8217;s going on here?
