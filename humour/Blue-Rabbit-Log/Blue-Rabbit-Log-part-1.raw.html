The camera rotates to the left to reveal the dark silhouette of a castle. It focuses on it. A lightning bolt strikes it. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">A Distant Voice from the castle’s top:</strong> No, it didn’t do.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The lightning strikes again. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Voice:</strong> One more try.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The lightning strikes again and a torch is lightened on the castle’s roof. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Voice:</strong> That’s it.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ After a few seconds the camera shows a man wearing a dark suit looking over a large window. The room is lit by a fireplace, which causes the shadow of the man to flicker. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dark man (Mordox):</strong> I thank you for agreeing to come here from your distant base, oh great Warlock Galku. You’ve acquired quite a reputation for yourself and I believe you’re just what I need. I think your objective is obvious. In fact, I give you three guesses to guess why I summoned you here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku (who is out of the frame):</strong> One: The Blue Rabbit’s Adventuring Company. Two: The Blue Rabbit’s Adventuring Company, and three: both of the above.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Exactly, now I understand you specialise in getting rid of such … eh… disturbances.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Yes, it is my speciality to neutralise such characters who prevent raising your ambitious evil projects.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> What did you say?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I said I get rid of such characters who prevent raising your evil projects.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> You said my projects are evil? How dare you! My projects are in no way evil.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Then what are they?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> They are just incredibly selfish and totally inconsiderate of everybody else’s welfare and interests.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I couldn’t define “evil” better myself.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Did I get you here to write a dictionary of the English language?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> No, but as a matter of fact I am writing one myself, as a hobby. The last word I wrote the definition for was “evidently”, and I think the next word would be...</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Cut it out! Now, where were we?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I just said it is my speciality to get rid of characters who prevent raising your incredibly selfish and totally inconsiderate of everybody else’s welfare and interests projects.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Yes, those so-called adventurers have interfered with my plans for a long time. What will I tell you? They ran into every one of my recent projects and messed with them so badly, I could count what was left from every one with one finger. They are too stupid to realize they put themselves in danger, but since they’ve got more luck than brains they seem to get out of it just fine.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> The worst thing about them is that they are the player characters, so the Game Master is on their side!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ At this point the floor starts shaking. The camera moves backwards to reveal Galku, and a big crack is starting to form between the two. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Quick! Take back what you just said or the Game Master will do something terrible!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Oh, OK. Even though they are the player characters the GM doesn’t seem to treat them any different and is very fair and objective.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The room stops trembling but the crack remains. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I think the crack adds a nice touch. <span class="inlinedesc">[and leaps to Mordox’s side.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Now, what were you planning to do about those … eh … disturbances.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Well, I figured it would be too difficult to get them killed. However, since, as far as I know, The Blue Rabbit Adventuring Company does not posses an inherent teleportation ability, it would be just as useful to relocate them to a place where they would not be troublesome.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> And how are you going to do it?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Well, I happen to have a one-way portal, which I borrowed from the great sorcerer Pinky.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> The same Pinky who created the spells “Pinky’s Clapping Hands”, “Pinky’s Wonderful Automatic Drummer”, “Pinky’s Anti-Bureaucratic Pounding Fist” and “Pinky’s Extraordinary Tickling Fingers?”</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> The very one! Anyway, with this port, if properly disguised, we’ll be able to send the “Blue Rabbits” on a one way trip to a place, thousand of kilometres away from anywhere remotely civilized.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> I love the sound of it. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ starts laughing loudly and Galku joins him. The camera rotates in a circular path to the right, and eventually reveals a large crystal blue. The crystal ball is showing a funny cartoon, and the two men are pointing at it and laughing. ]</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-credits-with-the-players"><header><h2 id="credits-with-the-players">Credits - The Players at the Table</h2></header><div class="description"><p>[ TODO : The players gather for the session. The camera shows the middle of the game table; about 80% of the table area is shown. We hear the players and stuff like that. The session takes place in the home of one of the players.</p><p>The right-lower corner of the screen shows the time display. At the beginning it reads “10:00 – Schedule Time”. The player puts on a CD, and the same song plays throughout the entire stuff. Various players come in at different times.</p><p>The clock shows various stuff: like several players talking gossip, or playing a computer game. Two players are making a contest to see who spins a die for the longest time.</p><p>Eventually the clock says: “10:54:37 – Schedule time plus the Epstein-Steinberg constant”. A few seconds afterwards, the last player rings on the door.</p><p>After the end of that frame the game commences. ]</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-the-player-characters-meet-their-challenge"><header><h2 id="the-player-characters-meet-their-challenge">The Player Characters meet their Challenge</h2></header><div class="description"><p>[ A crowded pub in the role-played world.
