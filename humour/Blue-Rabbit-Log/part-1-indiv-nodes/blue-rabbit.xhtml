The camera rotates to the left to reveal the dark silhouette of a castle. It focuses on it. A lightning bolt strikes it. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">A Distant Voice from the castle&#8217;s top:</strong> No, it didn&#8217;t do.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The lightning strikes again. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Voice:</strong> One more try.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The lightning strikes again and a torch is lightened on the castle&#8217;s roof. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Voice:</strong> That&#8217;s it.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ After a few seconds the camera shows a man wearing a dark suit looking over a large window. The room is lit by a fireplace, which causes the shadow of the man to flicker. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Dark man (Mordox):</strong> I thank you for agreeing to come here from your distant base, oh great Warlock Galku. You&#8217;ve acquired quite a reputation for yourself and I believe you&#8217;re just what I need. I think your objective is obvious. In fact, I give you three guesses to guess why I summoned you here.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku (who is out of the frame):</strong> One: The Blue Rabbit&#8217;s Adventuring Company. Two: The Blue Rabbit&#8217;s Adventuring Company, and three: both of the above.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Exactly, now I understand you specialise in getting rid of such &#8230; eh&#8230; disturbances.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Yes, it is my speciality to neutralise such characters who prevent raising your ambitious evil projects.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> What did you say?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I said I get rid of such characters who prevent raising your evil projects.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> You said my projects are evil? How dare you! My projects are in no way evil.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Then what are they?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> They are just incredibly selfish and totally inconsiderate of everybody else&#8217;s welfare and interests.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I couldn&#8217;t define &#8220;evil&#8221; better myself.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Did I get you here to write a dictionary of the English language?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> No, but as a matter of fact I am writing one myself, as a hobby. The last word I wrote the definition for was &#8220;evidently&#8221;, and I think the next word would be...</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Cut it out! Now, where were we?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I just said it is my speciality to get rid of characters who prevent raising your incredibly selfish and totally inconsiderate of everybody else&#8217;s welfare and interests projects.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Yes, those so-called adventurers have interfered with my plans for a long time. What will I tell you? They ran into every one of my recent projects and messed with them so badly, I could count what was left from every one with one finger. They are too stupid to realize they put themselves in danger, but since they&#8217;ve got more luck than brains they seem to get out of it just fine.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> The worst thing about them is that they are the player characters, so the Game Master is on their side!</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ At this point the floor starts shaking. The camera moves backwards to reveal Galku, and a big crack is starting to form between the two. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Quick! Take back what you just said or the Game Master will do something terrible!</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Oh, OK. Even though they are the player characters the GM doesn&#8217;t seem to treat them any different and is very fair and objective.</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ The room stops trembling but the crack remains. ]</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> I think the crack adds a nice touch. <span class="inlinedesc">[and leaps to Mordox&#8217;s side.]</span></p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> Now, what were you planning to do about those &#8230; eh &#8230; disturbances.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Well, I figured it would be too difficult to get them killed. However, since, as far as I know, The Blue Rabbit Adventuring Company does not posses an inherent teleportation ability, it would be just as useful to relocate them to a place where they would not be troublesome.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> And how are you going to do it?</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> Well, I happen to have a one-way portal, which I borrowed from the great sorcerer Pinky.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> The same Pinky who created the spells &#8220;Pinky&#8217;s Clapping Hands&#8221;, &#8220;Pinky&#8217;s Wonderful Automatic Drummer&#8221;, &#8220;Pinky&#8217;s Anti-Bureaucratic Pounding Fist&#8221; and &#8220;Pinky&#8217;s Extraordinary Tickling Fingers?&#8221;</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Galku:</strong> The very one! Anyway, with this port, if properly disguised, we&#8217;ll be able to send the &#8220;Blue Rabbits&#8221; on a one way trip to a place, thousand of kilometres away from anywhere remotely civilized.</p></div><div class="saying"><p><strong class="sayer">Mordox:</strong> I love the sound of it. Ha ha! Ha ha! Ha ha ha ha</p></div><div class="description"><p>[ starts laughing loudly and Galku joins him. The camera rotates in a circular path to the right, and eventually reveals a large crystal blue. The crystal ball is showing a funny cartoon, and the two men are pointing at it and laughing. ]</p></div></section><section class="scene" id="scene-credits-with-the-players"><header><h3 id="credits-with-the-players">Credits - The Players at the Table</h3></header><div class="description"><p>[ TODO : The players gather for the session.

The player puts on a CD, and the same song plays throughout the entire stuff.
