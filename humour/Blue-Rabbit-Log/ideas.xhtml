(“and now you will observe your true selves…”). While they are seeing them they are very awe-inspired and excited. Afterwards, they talk about all the things that changed in their players since the last time they saw them. At the end Bryte says “and did you see mine?

At the beginning there is an idyllic natural scene like Bambi, and then the boomerang flies all over the scene and ruins it. Then there is a zoom out of that part of the forest and the boomerang is acting like a pinball ball. (cave full of bats who are coming out as a high-score mechanism). Eventually, there are World’s Wildlife Fund crews all over the place.</p><p>She was supposed to hit a mark in the tree and eventually one of the PCs says: “well, you did hit the mark.”</p></section><section class="h3"><h3 id="karl-the-knife-thrower">Karl the Knife-Thrower (or maybe knife → dagger)</h3><p>He throws a knife at a bulls-eye on a tree, the knife hits the bulls-eye with its handle, compresses like a spring and bounces back into his hand. He tries it one more time and the same thing happens. Then, he holds the knife by its blade and throws it at the tree. Then, the knife hits the bulls-eye with its blade, and the entire tree from the bulls-eye downward gets compressed and the tree flies at him.</p><p>Afterwards, when they encounter a monster at the castle, he throws the knife while holding its blade, and then lies on the ground.

Then it falls down to hit the bulls eye, but a terrified bird sets it off its course, and it hits Bryte’s buttocks instead.</p><p>Bryte screams in pain and then shouts “You!”, and grabs Tilyo and throws him.

Then there are the higher deities: Korzolowa, Panktoress, Esmion who control galaxies. Above them are the supreme gods: Chenawortol, Passdorectla, Mantisorlor : they control existences and realities.</p><p>And above them all there is the Game Master: Ron Brown.</p><p>In any case, I discovered that there is an entity above the game master.”</p><p>Swashbuckler: Really?

At the beginning they fight each other, while keep lowering their prices in order to save the PCs from the other one. (“Do not believe him! He will fill your minds with disinformation, misinformation or just plain information.”) Eventually, the PCs tell them that they will hire both of them for free.
