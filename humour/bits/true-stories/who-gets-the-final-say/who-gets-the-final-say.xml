<title>The story</title>
<simpara>During one taxicab ride I took (I think it was from <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv">Tel Aviv</link>
to <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haifa">Haifa</link>) we picked up a couple where the man was
a Hebrew-speaking Israeli and his fiancée, who had an East Asian complexion and was an immigrant,
didn’t speak Hebrew well and we spoke to her in English.</simpara>
<simpara>We got to talk about relationships, and the driver decided to ask people we saw beside the road
"who gets the final say, before and after marriage?".</simpara>
<simpara>The driver stopped beside the road and asked one young woman that and she said: "[before?] the man" and "[after?] the woman".</simpara>
<simpara>A different one we asked told us "The woman gets the final say, both before and after the marriage."</simpara>
<simpara>We translated what they told us to English for the fiancée, and her Hebrew-speaking fiancé
insisted they had mutual agreement as a couple.</simpara>
<simpara>True story.</simpara>
