This is expected, as there are many bad tutorials out there, and lots of bad code that people have learned from, but it is still not desirable. To encourage best practices, here is a document of some of the common bad elements that people tend to use and some better practices that should be used instead.</p><p>A book I read said, that as opposed to most previous idea systems, they were trying to <span class="bold"><strong>liquidate negatives</strong></span> instead of to instil positives in people. So in the spirit of liquidating negatives, this tutorial-in-reverse aims to show you what <span class="bold"><strong>not to do</strong></span>.</p><p><span class="bold"><strong>Note:</strong></span> Please don't think this advice is meant as gospel. There are some instances where one can expect to deviate from it, and a lot of it can be considered only the opinion of its originators.

The answer is that in this day and age of extremely fast computers, you should optimise for clarity and modularity first, and worry about speed when and if you find it becomes a problem. Professor Don Knuth had this to say about it:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The improvement in speed from Example 2 to Example 2a is only about 12%, and many people would pronounce that insignificant. The conventional wisdom shared by many of today's software engineers calls for ignoring efficiency in the small; but I believe this is simply an overreaction to the abuses they see being practiced by penny-wise-and-pound-foolish programmers, who can't debug or maintain their "optimized" programs. In established engineering disciplines a 12% improvement, easily obtained, is never considered marginal; and I believe the same viewpoint should prevail in software engineering. Of course I wouldn't bother making such optimizations on a one-shot job, but when it's a question of preparing quality programs, I don't want to restrict myself to tools that deny me such efficiencies.</p><p>There is no doubt that the grail of efficiency leads to abuse. Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.</p></blockquote></div><p>(Knuth reportedly attributed the exact quote it to C.A.R. Hoare).</p><p>While you should be conscious of efficiency, and the performance sanity of your code and algorithms when you write programs, excessive and premature micro-optimisations are probably not going to yield a major performance difference.</p><p>If you do find that your program runs too slowly, refer to our <a class="link" href="http://c-begin.wikia.com/wiki/Profiling_and_Optimizing">resources about Optimising and Profiling code</a>.</p></section><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="version_control" class="title">Not Using Version Control</h4></div></div></div><p>For everything except for short throwaway scripts, or otherwise incredibly short programs, there is no good excuse, not to use a version control system (a.k.a: "revision control systems", "source control systems", or more in general as part of "software configuration management").
