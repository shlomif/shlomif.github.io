<span class="synComment">; -----</span>

<span class="synComment">; 1. In this lecture, we have used &quot;define&quot; to define commonly used</span>
<span class="synComment">; functions. However, we can write the whole program with all the functions</span>
<span class="synComment">; defined by such constructs:</span>

(
    (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (succ)
        (
            <span class="synComment">;;; Do something with succ - for example:</span>
            (succ (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (f) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (f (f (f x))))))
        )
    )
    <span class="synComment">; This is the definition of succ that is accepted as a value to the</span>
    <span class="synComment">; function call.</span>
    (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (n)
            (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (f)
                (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x)
                        (f ((n f) x))
                )
        )
    )
)

<span class="synComment">; 2. Representing arrays: arrays (a.k.a vectors) can be constructed using</span>
<span class="synComment">; a binary tree complex of pairs whose leaves are the array's values.</span>

<span class="synComment">; 3. Church Numerals are base-1 numbers so they are not very efficient. If</span>
<span class="synComment">; you strive for calculation efficiency in lambda calculus you may wish</span>
<span class="synComment">; to represent numbers as vectors of digits, and define calculations on them</span>
<span class="synComment">; using Al-Khwarizmi's algorithms.</span>

<span class="synComment">; 4. In order to do things like write to the screen, to files, or etc. You</span>
<span class="synComment">; need to supply the lambda calculus program with stubs. That way, everything</span>
<span class="synComment">; can be done in LC.</span>

<span class="synComment">; 5. It was proved that every recursive function can be implemented in</span>
<span class="synComment">; Lambda Calculus.</span>

<span class="synComment">; 6. Lambda Calculus is fairly easy to write in languages that support lexical</span>
<span class="synComment">; scoping and closures. For example: Scheme, Perl, Python and ML</span>
<span class="synComment">; can all do LC without any special programming.</span>

<span class="synComment">; In other languages, like C, Pascal, Assembly or Basic, one can implement</span>
<span class="synComment">; Lambda Calculus using a stack. I don't remember the exact details, but it's</span>
<span class="synComment">; possible.</span>

<span class="synComment">; 7. One can define Y-like combinators that take functions of more than</span>
<span class="synComment">; one argument (I mean (lambda (x) (lambda (y) ... ))). For example, the</span>
<span class="synComment">; two-argument Y is:</span>

(<span class="synStatement">define</span> Y2
    (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (g)
        (
            (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (f)
                (g (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (y) (((f f) x) y))))
            )
            (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (f)
                (g (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (y) (((f f) x) y))))
            )
        )
    )
)

<span class="synComment">; 8. Instead of using pairs one can use a three-object tuple, or a four object</span>
<span class="synComment">; tuple, etc. For example, the definition of the three-item tuple functions</span>
<span class="synComment">; are:</span>

(<span class="synStatement">define</span> lc-cons-tuple3
    (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (first)
        (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (second)
            (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (third)
                (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (which)
                    (((which first) second) third)
                )
            )
        )
    )
)

(<span class="synStatement">define</span> tuple3-get-first
    (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (tuple)
        (tuple (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (y) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (z) x))))
    )
)

(<span class="synStatement">define</span> tuple3-get-second
    (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (tuple)
        (tuple (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (y) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (z) y))))
    )
)

(<span class="synStatement">define</span> tuple3-get-third
    (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (tuple)
        (tuple (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (y) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (z) z))))
    )
)

<span class="synComment">; 9. It is sometimes useful to make a lambda expression into a tuple in which</span>
<span class="synComment">; its car is a Church numeral that denotes its type, and specifies whether</span>
<span class="synComment">; the cdr is a tuple, a church numeral, a function, a vector, etc.</span>

<span class="synComment">; 10. Lambda Calculus still has a certain degree of arbitrarity. For example:</span>
<span class="synComment">; Church numerals could have been defined as:</span>

(<span class="synStatement">define</span> zero (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (f) x)))
(<span class="synStatement">define</span> one  (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (f) (f x))))
(<span class="synStatement">define</span> two  (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (x) (<span class="synStatement">lambda</span> (f) (f (f x)))))

<span class="synComment">; Etc.</span>
<span class="synComment">; Or true could have been defined as false and false as true...</span>
