Should you worry about it?</li><li>Usually there's nothing to be fear. The GPL (and all other <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software licenses</a>) explicitly allow making use (and even modifying) the software for internal use.</li><li>Software that operates web-sites is considered software for internal use, as it is not distributed to the outside.</li></ul><h2>Amazon.com as an Example</h2><ul class="point"><li>If we take Amazon.com for example, then they may make use of GPLed code for their web-site.</li><li>If, however, they decide to distribute the code as a framework that allows setting up similar sites (say Amazonware), then they'll have to either comply by the terms of the GPL, and distribute it under a compatible free software license, or alternatively eliminate the use of the GPLed software.</li><li>(Or if the option permits, get the copyright owner of the GPLed software to exempt them from the GPL somehow.)</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><ul class="point"><li>This presentation was directed primarily at people who manage or wish to set up web-sites.</li><li>If you want to sell a framework that will facilitate setting up web-sites using LAMP, I wish you the best of luck, but you'll have to handle the legal problems involved in making use of open-source (and proprietary) software available on your own.</li><li>Generally note that the distribution terms of proprietary software may give you even more trouble, as far as basing a web-site on them is concerned.</li></ul><hr/></main><nav><table class="page-nav-bar bottom"><tr><td><a href="../" class="nav">Contents</a></td><td><a href="./" class="nav">Up</a></td><td><a href="./" class="nav">Prev</a></td><td><b>Next</b></td></tr></table></nav><p>Written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a></p><footer></footer></body></html>
