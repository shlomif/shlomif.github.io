It is usually a bad idea.</li><li>Getting JavaScript code to work properly on all browsers is more difficult than getting a static HTML to do so. (or at least it can never be easier).</li><li>Most JavaScript code is unnecessary. It adds more gizmos to the site, but not more functionality.</li><li>By adding unnecessary embellishments to the site, you make them more prone to browser bugs, and mis-features; you make the site harder (and more costly) to maintain and you usually don't add much to the user experience to be worth it.</li><li>An extreme example of this are pages that use HTML 4.x markup without any CSS or other visual embellishments. If you do this, I guarantee you that your portability problems are over.</li><li>( I wouldn't recommend this extreme, because it will make your pages quite boring, but it still illustrates a point. )</li></ul><hr/></main><nav><table class="page-nav-bar bottom"><tr><td><a href="../" class="nav">Contents</a></td><td><a href="./" class="nav">Up</a></td><td><a href="standards.html" class="nav">Prev</a></td><td><a href="words-of-wisdom.html" class="nav">Next</a></td></tr></table></nav><p>Written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a></p><footer></footer></body></html>
