The reason for its creation was that Wall was unhappy by the functionality that sed, C, awk and the Bourne Shell offered him. He looked for a language that will combine all of their best features, while having as few disadvantages of its own.</p><p>Since then, perl has seen several versions, each adding additional functionality. perl version 5, which was released in 1994, was a complete re-write of the perl interpreter, and introduced such things as hard references, modules, objects and lexical scoping. Several second-digit versions of perl 5 appeared since then, and the most up-to-date stable version (as of November 2010) is 5.12.x.</p><p>Perl became especially popular as a language for writing server-side scripts for web-servers. But that's not the only use of perl, as it is commonly used for system administration tasks, managing database data, as well as writing GUI applications.</p><h3>Links:</h3><ul><li><p><a href="http://history.perl.org/PerlTimeline.html">The Perl Timeline</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?history">Perl's history on the Perl 5 Wiki</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/Perl/Newbies/vhll-slides.pdf"><i>The Taming of the Camel</i></a> - a lecture by Larry Wall about the Evolution of Perl.</p></li></ul><hr/></main><nav><table class="page-nav-bar bottom"><tr><td><a href="../" class="nav">Contents</a></td><td><a href="./" class="nav">Up</a></td><td><a href="capabilities.html" class="nav">Prev</a></td><td><a href="devel_cycle.html" class="nav">Next</a></td></tr></table></nav><p>Written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a></p><footer></footer></body></html>
