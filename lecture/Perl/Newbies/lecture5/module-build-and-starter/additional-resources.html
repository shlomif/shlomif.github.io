It was <a href="http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2008/09/msg140206.html">described by chromatic</a> as <q>a jumble of Perl which writes cross platform shell scripts to install Perl code, and you customize that by writing a superclass from which platform-specific modules inherit pseudo-methods which use regular expressions to search and replace cross-platform cross-shell code, with all of the cross-platform and cross-shell quoting issues that entails</q> .</p></li><li><p><a href="http://metacpan.org/release/Module-Install/"><b>Module-Install</b></a> is a more modern and succinct wrapper around ExtUtils-MakeMaker that has gained some popularity. It ships its code (and the code of its extensions) under an <code>./inc</code> directory in the distribution, which has known to cause some bootstrapping issues for co-developers who would like to collaborate on the code from its version control repository. Nevertheless, it may be worth taking a look.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://www.apress.com/open-source/programming/9781590590188"><b><i>Writing Perl Modules for CPAN</i></b></a> is a book by Sam Tregar, which has a free PDF download. It is somewhat out-of-date (only covering ExtUtils-MakeMaker), but may still be enlightening.</p></li><li><p><a href="http://dzil.org/"><b>Dist::Zilla</b></a> is a high-level distribution generator, with many available plugins, that abstracts away a lot of the duplication within a module and across modules. It generates fully-functional distributions that can be shipped to CPAN and used normally. As with Module-Install, it may pose a problem to your contributors, especially if they have out-of-date versions of its CPAN modules installed, but it is a useful tool.</p></li><li><p>A Perlmonks.org post titled <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=879515"><b>“RFC: How to Release Modules on CPAN in 2011”</b></a> goes to more coverage about the issues covered in this section.</p></li><li><p>Jeffrey Thalhammer has prepared a talk titled <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/thaljef/cpan-for-private-code">“CPAN for Private Code”</a> which gives the motivation for packaging Perl code in CPAN-like distributions, even if it is not intended for CPAN.</p></li></ol><hr/></main><nav><table class="page-nav-bar bottom"><tr><td><a href="../" class="nav">Contents</a></td><td><a href="./" class="nav">Up</a></td><td><a href="boilerplate.html" class="nav">Prev</a></td><td><a href="../conclusion/" class="nav">Next</a></td></tr></table></nav><p>Written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a></p><footer></footer></body></html>
