The question is: why would anyone ever want to do that? <b>:-)</b></p><p>No, seriously. We hoped you enjoyed the lecture series, but remember that it does not teach you everything that is to know about perl, much less how to understand other people's code.</p><p>By now, you can probably understand the perl core documents, so it is recommended that you read them in case you are looking for more information. You can also refer to <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">the Perl Beginners' Site</a> for more sources of information as well as ways to get help online.</p><p>We hope to continue this lecture with more presentations covering Perl's modules, objects and references to functions. Until then, stay cool and may the dollar sign be with you!</p><hr/></main><nav><table class="page-nav-bar bottom"><tr><td><a href="./" class="nav">Contents</a></td><td><a href="./" class="nav">Up</a></td><td><a href="debugger/more_info.html" class="nav">Prev</a></td><td><b>Next</b></td></tr></table></nav><p>Written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a></p><footer></footer></body></html>
