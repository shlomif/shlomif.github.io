An expression that holds such a location is called a <b>reference</b>. Those that are familiar with C's or Pascal's pointers may think of references as pointers. There are however, two fundamental differences:</p><ol><li>There is no reference arithmetics in perl. If for example, a reference points to the fifth element of an array, then adding 1 to it will not refer you to the sixth element. In fact, adding or subtracting integers from references is possible but quite meaningless.</li><li>A reference is guaranteed to remain the same even if an array or a string are resized. In C, <code>realloc</code>ing an array yields a completely different pointer.</li></ol><p>Perl distinguishes between an array or a hash and a reference of it. The reference of any array may be taken, and a reference to an array may always be converted to its elements, but there is still a difference in functionality.</p><p>The best way to change a variable in a different scope (such as inside a different function) is to pass its reference to the function. The called function can then dereference the variable to access or modify its value.</p><hr/></main><nav><table class="page-nav-bar bottom"><tr><td><a href="../" class="nav">Contents</a></td><td><a href="../" class="nav">Up</a></td><td><a href="../useful_funcs/grep.html" class="nav">Prev</a></td><td><a href="hanoi.html" class="nav">Next</a></td></tr></table></nav><p>Written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a></p><footer></footer></body></html>
