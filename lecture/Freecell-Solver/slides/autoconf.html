I can just say that it is not very straightforward, and that it required a lot of tweaking and trial and error.</li><li>I then decided that having an RPM of Freecell Solver would be nice. So I created an RPM spec for it.</li><li>Again, it required quite a lot of tweaking and experimenting. (<a href="http://www.haifux.org/lectures/31/">Tzafrir Cohen's Lecture</a> and various web-resources were a great help)</li><li>I eventually integrated generating an up-to-date RPM SPEC into the Autoconf process, and thus, was able to build an RPM by issuing a constant sequence of commands.</li><li>A corresponding Debian package has been initially created by Yotam Rubin and is now maintained by Risko Gergely, who also uploads it to the Debian pool of packages.</li></ul><hr/></main><nav><table class="page-nav-bar bottom"><tr><td><a href="./" class="nav">Contents</a></td><td><a href="./" class="nav">Up</a></td><td><a href="api.html" class="nav">Prev</a></td><td><a href="freshmeat_effect.html" class="nav">Next</a></td></tr></table></nav><p>Written by <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish</a></p><footer></footer></body></html>
