--><h2>2020-10-06: Tech Tips: Sound on Fedora; neovim build; add committers on src.fedoraproject.org; nginx warning on startup</h2><p>This is a collection of recent tech tips, which I decided to share.</p><ol><li><p>The <a href="https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/753a86c01a02383df5faab3831a5d275c81f0b6d/Makefile#L11">default CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE in neovim's wrapper makefile</a> is <code>Debug</code> which generates slower code than <code>Release</code>. So make sure you use a command similar to this one to build it: <code>make CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release CMAKE_EXTRA_FLAGS="-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=$HOME/apps/neovim"</code>.</p><p>It may be a testament to neovim's efficiency that I found its speed acceptable even when it was built in “Debug” mode.</p></li><li><p>When trying to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nginx">nginx</a> with a custom configuration file, by executing for example: <code>nginx -c ~/conf/trunk/shlomif-settings/nginx/httpd/minimal-nginx.conf</code> using the <code>-c</code> flag, nginx may emit this warning:</p><pre>
[shlomif@localhost ~]$ nginx -c ~/conf/trunk/shlomif-settings/nginx/httpd/minimal-nginx.conf
nginx: [alert] could not open error log file: open() "/var/log/nginx/error.log" failed (13: Permission denied)
</pre><p>This warning should be ignored, and is output even if the configuration file sets the log file's path to a different value. Instead, one should handle the errors which follow it. ( I was told that eliminating this misfeature will be problematic for nginx, given its architecture, so I wanted to document that. )</p></li><li><p>Sometimes the sound gets muted on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)">Fedora Linux</a> when using a desktop. What has been working for me to unmute it is to execute <code>systemctl --user stop pulseaudio.service</code> as your desktop (non-root) user in the command line. <code>systemctl --user restart pulseaudio.service</code> may be even more preferable but on my system pulseaudio starts again automatically after being stopped.</p></li><li><p>In order to add new contributors with commit or admin privileges to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)">Fedora Linux</a> packages, one should go to the package's page on <a href="https://src.fedoraproject.org/">src.fedoraproject.org</a> and then to <code>Settings → Users &amp; Groups</code>.</p></li><li><p>When testing web sites and web applications, it is advisable to test <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment#Staging">staging</a> versions on a localhost web service (e.g: <code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/</code>) because caching may interfere with the version served to you on remote Internet hosts.</p></li></ol><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot">Happy Sukkoth</a> everyone!</p><h2>Licence</h2><p>Copyright by Shlomi Fish, 2020.</p><p>You can reuse this entry under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 Unported</a> licence, or at your option any later version of it.

--><h2>2020-02-21: Tech Tip: Setting up remote X11 over TCP to Xephyr</h2><p><b>Warning!</b> The instructions given here may decrease your systems' security and may make it more vulnerable. Use at your own risk.</p><p>I recently wanted to set up a remote <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X.Org_Server">X.org / X11</a> connection to a Xephyr server, which is an X server that runs inside a window. I only found partial information in web searches, so I wanted to provide a top-to-bottom guide for accomplishing this task.</p><p>The <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xephyr">Xephyr man page</a> omits the info in <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xnest">Xnest's man page</a> and that in <a href="https://linux.die.net/man/1/xserver">the "Xserver" man page</a>. Xephyr supports most of the flags in all of them.</p><p>To facilitate customisation, we will declare and use the following shell constants:</p><pre>
xephyr_port="1"
remote_xephyr_ip_host="192.168.1.100"
</pre><p>You may need to stop the firewalls on both client and server using something like:</p><pre>
sudo systemctl stop firewalld.service
</pre><p>Or the <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-computer-settings/blob/e9de56aa212706f5c1fc3906c2f0b92065851965/shlomif-settings/home-bin-executables/bin/stop-iptables">stop-iptables script</a>.</p><p>Now start Xephyr on the local desktop:</p><pre>
Xephyr -listen tcp -listen unix -listen local -screen 1024x768 :"$xephyr_port"
</pre><p>Then connect to it and use <code>xhost</code>:</p><pre>
# On the X server
export DISPLAY=":$xephyr_port"
xterm &amp;
xhost +
</pre><p>Now you should be able to connect to the Xephyr X server from the remote box:</p><pre>
# On the remote machine
export DISPLAY="$remote_xephyr_ip_host":"$xephyr_port"
xterm &amp;
# Or a different window manager.

One can initialize them from dynamically-typed python data structures.</p></li><li><p>One can copy+paste the compiler's invocation command on the command line and edit it to apply better optimisation flags. There may be a way to customise the compilation command by editing the “setup.py” file, but I didn't bother to figure it out yet.</p></li><li><p>One can and should inspect the generated .c file to see the resultant C code to see if anything is done sub-optimally.</p></li></ol><h2>Licence</h2><p>Copyright by Shlomi Fish, 2017.</p><p>You can reuse this entry under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported</a> licence, or at your option any later version of it.

I recently found a solution for that which I'd like to share.</p><p>First of all, login to <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/themes/">the Mozilla addons site</a> and access and bookmark <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/collections/mine/favorites/format%3Ajson?src=">the JSON data file’s URL</a>. Save it to a file and host it using a local HTTP service (such as Apache, <a href="http://www.garyrobinson.net/2004/03/one_line_python.html">the one line Python HTTP service</a> command line, or <a href="http://opensource.dyc.edu/sthttpd">sthttpd</a>’s “thttpd -p $PORT” invocation).</p><p>Then, go to Firefox’s “about:config”, access the “extensions.personas.favorites-feed.url” key and change it to the locally served one. It should work fine after restarting Firefox, and one upside to it would be that you no longer need to be logged in to addons.mozilla.org for it to work.</p><p>Remember to save the file again every once-in-a-while, after you have added new favourites. A final note is that a “file://” URL may work fine as well, but I have not tried it yet.</p><p>Happy rotating, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah">Shanah Tovah</a> if appropriate!</p><h2>Licence</h2><p>Copyright by Shlomi Fish, 2015.</p><p>You can reuse this entry under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported</a> licence, or at your option any later version of it.

Now, one problem I ran into when using it is that “minicpan” did not seem to delete the older downloaded releases after they were superseded by newer ones. A few days ago I found a solution to this problem.</p><p>What you can do is:</p><ol><li><p>Move away the minicpan’s mirror’s top directory (<b>do not delete it!</b>)</p></li><li><p>Set up a localhost HTTP service on a high TCP port which will serve the moved minicpan directory. For that you can use <a href="http://www.garyrobinson.net/2004/03/one_line_python.html">the one line Python HTTP service</a> command line or <a href="http://opensource.dyc.edu/sthttpd">sthttpd</a>’s “thttpd -p $PORT” invocation or whatever.</p></li><li><p>Run the “minicpan” command while pointing the remote to the localhost mirror of the old minicpan mirror, using the “-r” flag or by temporarily editing the “~/.minicpanrc” file.</p></li></ol><p>Voila! Now the mirror will only contain the latest releases, and you can remove the old, moved-away, minicpan directory, and cancel the HTTP service.</p><h2>Licence</h2><p>Copyright by Shlomi Fish, 2015.</p><p>You can reuse this entry under <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported</a> licence, or at your option any later version of it.

--><h2>2015-07-14: Tech Tip: Skip Tests in RPM .spec Files conditionally-to-version</h2><p>Let’s suppose you are packaging a software application using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager">RPM</a> or a similar packaging system, and this application contains some automated tests that can be run using “make test”, “make check” or similar. You may opt to put them inside a “%check” section, but the problem now is that they may fail.</p><p>The solution I used in this case (assuming fixing the tests was out of scope of my work as a packager) was to comment out the command that ran the tests, but this is not ideal because that way the tests will also be disabled in subsequent versions of the application, unless the packager remembers to reenable them.</p><p>Recently, I discovered a better way to do that, after inspecting the source of a <a href="http://www.mageia.org/en/">Mageia Linux</a> package. One needs do something like that:</p><pre>
%define known_to_fail_version 1.82

%check

if test "%{version}" = "%{known_to_fail_version}" ; then
    true
else
    # Run the tests.
    make check
fi
</pre><p>This way, the tests will get run again for subsequent versions of the packaged application, and if they fail again one can set “known_to_fail_version” to a new value.</p><p>I hope you also find it a cool trick.

There was a service that did “git clone” and then allowed people to download using HTTPS Called “Git bundler” but it has been down for sometime now. However, I found a different solution to the problem.</p><p>What can be done is use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell"><b>ssh</b></a> to log in to a remote host, where the “git clone” is performed (preferably, but not absolutely necessarily, when running on top of a session of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux">tmux</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Screen">GNU Screen</a> or similar).

--><h2>2012-02-18: Tech Tips: Vim, Facebook and Firefox’s Personas Rotator Extension</h2><p>Here are three tech tips, that I felt did not necessitate their own entry.</p><p>In the <b>Vim</b> text editor(<a href="http://www.vim.org/">homepage</a>), one can use the keybinding <code>Ctrl+W ; O</code> to close all windows except the current one, which will be the <b>only</b> one left open (hence the "O").</p><p>In <b>Facebook</b> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook">Wikipedia page</a>) one can use Shift+Enter to start newlines in the messages you compose in the site’s composer. Press it twice to start a new paragraph.</p><p>If you are using <b>Firefox’s Personas Rotator Extension</b> ( <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/personas-rotator/">Addons.mozilla.org page</a>), then you can switch the currently shown persona ( in case you don't want it at the moment) using Ctrl+Alt+P or an alternate configurable keybinding. I discovered this latest tip by accident and can no longer imagine my life without it.</p><p>Cheers!</p></div><div class="entry" id="vim-tips-2012-02-18"><!-- Tags: vim, tip, vim tip, tech, tech tip, perl
--><h2>2012-02-18: Vim Tips: scp URLs, "set tabpagemax" and fixing C indentation</h2><p>Here are some Vim tips I ran into recently. First of all, when opening <code>scp://</code> URLs, one should use two slashes after the hostname instead of 1, like <code>scp://hostname//home/myuser/foo.txt</code> instead of <code>scp://hostname/home/myuser/foo.txt</code>. I don’t know why that is the case, but it does not work properly without it. It also seems that netrw is buggy as it displays an irritating grey line on the cursor, the syntax highlighting tends to be off and saving a file displays several lines at the bottom.</p><p>Another tip is that gvim limits the number of tabs it opens when doing <code>gvim -p [file1] [file2] [file3]</code>. As a result, it is possible that not all files will be opened. If you want to change it you can set <code>set tabpagemax</code> in your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p><p>Finally, I noticed that Vim c-indentation tends to indent parameters to functions on subsequent lines using 8 spaces instead of 4 by default. I was able to change it to 4, which is my preference by adding <code>set cinoptions+='(0,W4'</code> to my <code>.vimrc</code>. There is plenty of other nifty stuff available in the <code>cinoptions</code> parameter.</p><p>Enjoy!</p></div><div class="entry" id="git-tip-dot-git-config"><!-- Tags: git, perl, tip, tech tip, tech
--><h2>2012-01-22: git tip: adding remotes to .git/config</h2><p>When working with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29">git version control system</a> and editing <code>.git/config</code> to add a new remote, some people may be tempted to copy and change the <code>origin</code> remote that reads something like:</p><pre>
[remote "origin"]
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	url = git@github.com:shlomif/perl.git
</pre><p>However, note that <code>origin</code> also appears at the <code>fetch =</code> and needs to be changed there as well, or else all the branches will be placed in <code>remotes/origin</code>. Maybe there's a better way to add a new remote using the <code>git config</code> commands.</p><p>Other than that, I should note that there doesn't seem to be a consensus among git users whether <code>git pull --rebase</code> is better than a simple <code>git pull</code>: the perl people told me to use <code>--rebase</code> and the Amarok people and someone on Freenode's <code>##programming</code> told me not to use it. Now I'm just confused.</p></div><div class="entry" id="tech-tip-removing-bash-completions"><!-- Tags: tip, tech, tech tip, bash, linux
--><h2>2011-12-13: Tech Tip: Removing Bash’s Command Completions</h2><p>The normal way to remove a completion for a Bash command (say “mv”) is to do “complete -r mv”. However, with the bash-completion package installed on Mageia Linux Cauldron, this is not enough because it also adds a default completion for every invoked command. So in order to override this behaviour, type “complete -r -D” and then you can remove the commands’ completions permanently, using “complete -r mv” or whatever.</p></div><div class="entry" id="qunit-recommendation-and-tip"><!-- Tags: javascript, testing, qa, tech, tip, tech tip, perl, jquery
--><h2>2011-09-05: Recommendation and Tip: The QUnit JavaScript Automated Tests Library</h2><p>I've begun working on a JavaScript port of some algorithmic perl code, to allow it to run inside a browser. As a result, I had to find a good JavaScript automated tests library to allow me to write automated tests for the code. I first looked at Test.More and Test.Harness from JSAN (the JavaScript Archive Network) but as it turned out, JSAN was defunct, and no one had time to mark it as such. Then I asked the “Test.Run” developer (another thing I had found on jsan) to instruct me how to get it up and running, and he gave me a link to its archive, which was 1.5 mb compressed (!), and so was not acceptable.</p><p>I looked at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/list_of_unit_testing_frameworks#javascript">the Wikipedia list of unit testing frameworks</a>, but there were too many. at least I understood that jsUnit was no longer actively maintained. I looked at Jasmine, which is a bdd framework for JS, but its syntax seemed too horrid and unnatural.</p><p>Eventually, I decided to ask for recommendation on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> and, as after I wrote my title, I found a <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/96066/automated-unit-testing-with-javascript">a previous question</a>, where there was a recommendation of <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Qunit">QUnit</a>, which I noticed was developed by the jQuery people, and as I'm fond of jQuery, I decided to look deeper into it.</p><p>I wasn't disappointed by QUnit - it does what it does well, and I was able to write my test suite using it, so I can recommend it as well. It has primitives that are very similar to perl's <a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Test::More">Test::More</a>, and it can even assert that the number of assertions ran within a test are right (like Test::More can).</p><p>So here's a tip for it: if you're writing your testing code in a different file, and you wish to check that no compile-time or run-time exception was thrown (which will cause qunit to report a success with zero assertions) you should wrap the testing code in a <code>try { .. } catch</code> block and in the catch block, run <code>ok(false...)</code>.</p><p>Here's an example from my code:</p><pre>

So you can say <code>:w !grep 'FOO' | wc -l</code> to find the number of lines containing 'FOO', or <code>:'a,'bw !grep 'FOO' | wc -l</code> within a range.</p></li></ol><p>I should note that one thing that annoyed me lately, is the fact that after I have a visual selection (<code>v</code> or <code>V</code>), I sometimes press <code>u</code> instead of <code>y</code> (because they are so nearby) and so cause the selection to become lowercase instead of yanking it.</p><p>Happy Vimming!</p></div><div class="entry" id="tech-tip-kde4-change-virtual-desktop-names"><!-- Tags: tech, tip, tech tip, kde

In case, you don't know SQLite is an SQL database implemented as a small, yet very fast library, which, accesses everything from the file-system. Furthermore, it is open-source, public domain, and reliable.</p><p>Recently, I wanted to create a server-side script to individually display my <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/">fortune cookie quotes</a> - each on its own page based on its ID. In order to speed up the lookup, I decided to store everything in a <a href="http://perl-begin.org/uses/databases/">database</a>, be it the raw file-system, something like Berkeley DB or Tokyo Cabinet, or an SQL-based database. I ended up using SQLite, which worked pretty well.</p><p>I've written a program to populate the database by parsing the data from the XML source files and extracted the data from there. I prepared an INSERT statement:</p><pre>
my $insert_sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(&lt;&lt;'EOF');
INSERT INTO fortune_cookies (collection_id, str_id, title, text)
VALUES(?, ?, ?, ?)
EOF
</pre><p>(It started a bit simpler, but that's what I have now.)</p><p>And then I executed it for each record. It took a lot of time to complete - many minutes. So I consulted <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/#perl">#perl</a> about it and got a few suggestions:</p><ol><li><p>That I should disable the so-called “shared database” mode, which is the default SQLite mode that assumes other processes on the machine might access the database.</p></li><li><p>That I should turn off Autocommit and commit in batches with more than one record in each in every transaction.</p></li></ol><p>The number two option seemed the most likely, and I tried commiting in batches of 50 records each and it made the populating program finish in a few seconds. So I was very happy.</p><p>I guess I can try the shared database mode later on, since I populate the database offline. Now the program for displaying every quote individually is working nicely, and I am very happy. Thanks to the #perl people for helping me again.</p></div><div class="entry" id="fcs-c-pointer-comparison-gotcha"><!-- Tags: c, programming, tip, tech, tech tip

I've written a comparator function for it and asked my IRC pal Amadiro to test the new fc-solve with some memory optimisations on one of his University's HPC machines which he had access to. However, it crashed pretty quickly.</p><p>I was able to reproduce a similar crash on my x86-64 laptop, and tried to investigate it. Then it hit me, because the comparator callback was this:</p><pre>
extern int fc_solve_compare_lru_cache_keys(
    const void * void_a, const void * void_b, void * context
)
{
#define GET_PARAM(p) ((unsigned long) \
    ((const fcs_cache_key_info_t *)(p))-&gt;val_ptr)
    return GET_PARAM(void_a) - GET_PARAM(void_b);
}
</pre><p>Do you see the problem? Subtracting two <b>unsigned</b> longs will always yield a non-negative value, which will yield the comparison void. I considered several alternatives to this including using longs instead of unsigned longs (which will still be a problems on platforms where long is less than the pointer size), or subtracting <code>const char *</code> (which may overflow the <code>int</code> return) and eventually opted for the safest version of:</p><pre>
typedef const char * fcs_lru_side_t;

extern int fc_solve_compare_lru_cache_keys(
    const void * void_a, const void * void_b, void * context
)
{
#define GET_PARAM(p) ((fcs_lru_side_t) \
    (((const fcs_cache_key_info_t *)(p))-&gt;val_ptr))
    fcs_lru_side_t a, b;

    a = GET_PARAM(void_a);
    b = GET_PARAM(void_b);

    return ((a &gt; b) ? 1 : (a &gt; b) ? (-1) : 0);
#undef GET_PARAM
}

</pre><p>This way I'm sure that the comparison works correctly, and indeed after that Freecell Solver ran fine on the HPC machine, and would have appeared to scale to up to 600 million positions within 64 GigaBytes instead of the previous 400 million positions.</p><p>If you're a sucker for pretty graphs, you may wish to inspect <a href="http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/fc-solve/trunk/fc-solve/docs/fc-solve-rcs-mem-consumption.ods">the OpenDocument spreadsheet (.ods)</a> of the memory consumption of the solver, though the data is quite estimative.</p></div><div class="entry" id="tech-tips-kde-konqueror-detailed-and-dpi"><!-- Tags: tech tip, tip, tech, kde, gnome, linux, open source, foss

While there are many variables for this equation, my problem in a particular place, was that I tried to do it on a <a href="http://www.samba.org/">Samba SMB/CIFS share (a Windows-like share)</a> that was mounted with permissions of 755 and under my UNIX user-ID/group-ID (but still read-only) which fooled konqueror and dolphin to believe it could write its settings there.

My problem was that some X.Org applications such as KDE's Konsole, XFCE's Terminal and the IRC client <a href="http://xchat.org/">XChat</a> had larger fonts on XFCE and IceWM, than on GNOME and KDE. After a lot of trial and error with stracing the sessions, and moving away dot-directories and dot-files, I realised the GNOME problem was caused by a stray problem in ~/.gconf/ which moving that directory away solved it (one can solve it more hermetically by getting rid of the offending configuration problem, but I did not bother with it yet). The KDE problem persisted afterwards, but was easier to fix: I <a href="http://betterthangrep.com/">ack</a>ed ~/.kde4/share/config for "dpi" and found <code>share/config/kcmfonts</code> and a line in another file that set the dpi to a different value which I fixed, and that made both the GNOME and KDE font size and DPIs (dots-per-inches) to be the same as those of IceWM and XFCE. Now the relief has made me very happy.</p><p>If you find these tips helpful, drop me a note at the comments below.</p></div><div class="entry" id="tech-tip-single-click-on-URL-on-Linux-DTRT"><!-- Tags: tip, tech, tech tip, linux, mandriva, kde, firefox
--><h2>2010-10-28: Tech Tip: Making Single Click on a URL Do the Right Thing on Linux</h2><p>I had a long-time problem on my Mandriva Linux system where, after I set Firefox as the default browser on KDE, it either made KDE first download the page to the hard-disk and redirect Firefox to access it from <code>/var/tmp</code> - or, if I set the default browser to "firefox %u", it opened the link in a new window twice.</p><p>Today I decided to go to the bottom of it, after seeing that an upgrade of KDE on Mandriva Cooker did not fix the problem (which I was told would). After consulting some people on IRC, I realised that I could not reproduce the bug on a new UNIX user account, so it was a configuration problem here. Then I realised that <code>/usr/bin/www-browser</code> which is what the <code>BROWSER</code> environment variable points to also opens it this way. After looking through the source code of <code>www-browser</code>, and testing some command-line invocation of capture-shells there, I suspected the problem was with a stray <code>firefox.desktop</code> file.</p><p>Running locate found two such files inside my home directory: <code>/home/shlomif/.gnome2/panel2.d/default/launchers/firefox.desktop</code> and <code>/home/shlomif/.local/share/applications/firefox.desktop</code>. Moving away them both resolved the problem and now if the default browser is set to "firefox", the Firefox opens a link in a single new tab after a single click.</p><p>Cheers, and hope it helps.</p></div><div class="entry" id="perl-debugger-tip"><!-- Tags: perl, debugger, tip, tech, tech tip

Furthermore, I was unable to mirror other remote repositories. I wrote about it, asking for help:</p><ul><li><a href="http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/svk-users/2008-November/000380.html">Post to the svk-users mailing list</a></li><li><a href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_tech/19585.html">My "Problems with SVK" entry on this blog</a></li></ul><p>All of this has been left unsolved until yesterday when I decided that I had enough and wanted to finally resolve this problem. My first idea was to try to write a script that will propagate the changesets using the Subversion APIs, so I looked at the SVK code trying to see where exactly it happens. I found the SVK code hard-to-follow, so I first contemplated fixing what caused it to report an error, but was also unable to.</p><p>Then I joined the <a href="http://freenode.net/">Freenode IRC network</a> and went to the #svk channel. There was only one person there who tried to help me, and he was intermittent in helping. Then I joined #perl and casually mentioned that I thought SVK sucked (just to lose some steam), which prompted <a href="http://www.trout.me.uk/">mst</a> to try to help me. After interrogating me he suggested that in order to recover the changesets from SVK, I should follow the following steps:</p><ol><li>Find out what is the last SVK revision which still propagated changesets to the Subversion repository. This can be found using the commit message in the svn log.</li><li>Revert (using a selective <code>svnadmin dump</code> and then an <code>svnadmin create</code> ; and <code>svnadmin load</code>) to the older version of <code>~/.svk/local</code> that corresponds with the revision number of the commit. (While naturally keeping a copy of <code>~/.svk/local/</code> and its dump in a safe place.)</li><li>See that a simple change in the svk checkout (like <code>svk mkdir to-delete-`date +%s`</code>) will propagate to the remote repository.</li><li>Revert that change using the Subversion client directly.</li><li>Revert to the working-but-old copy of the SVK repository, and apply a filtered stream of the dumps (using <code>svndumpfilter</code>) that will exclude changes from the <code>//mirror</code> part of the SVK repository.</li><li>After all that is done, checkout the trunk and do <code>svk push</code> from there.</li></ol><p>Of course, the devil is in the details, and it took me a lot of experimentation until I got to something working. Facts I've discovered:</p><ol><li><a href="http://creatingwithcode.com/howto/extracting-projects-from-shared-svn/">svndumpfilter needs a dump that was generated without the <code>--deltas</code> flag</a> (and possibly without <code>--incremental</code> either. Otherwise it will complain.</li><li>I couldn't seem to get <code>svndumpfilter exclude mirror</code> to work and instead ended up using <code>svndumpfilter include local</code></li><li>The <code>--drop-empty-revs</code> and <code>--renumber-revs</code> flags to svndumpfilter which seemed like a good idea confused <code>svnadmin load</code>, and everything worked after I removed them.</li><li>Using <code>tar -czf</code> and <code>tar -xf</code> can really speed up restoring older versions of a Subversion repository because svnadmin load is pretty slow.</li><li>I ended up taking a range of repositories from the pristine revision to "HEAD" and then manually editing out the first revision. Maybe it was unnecessary.</li></ol><p>After all that, "svk push" worked and propagated 800 changesets to <a href="https://opensvn.csie.org/shlomif/homepage/trunk/">my homepage's trunk</a> in 8:20 hours (must be a record). Since I only have an ADSL connection with 25 KBps upstream, and the Subversion service is located in Taiwan and I'm living in Israel, it took a while and I left it overnight to run.</p><p>Today, after I woke up, I saw that the operation ended up successfully. I was able to build an up-to-date version of my homesite from the Subversion sources, and am mostly ready to stop using SVK.</p><p>Again, I'd like to thank <a href="http://www.trout.me.uk/">mst</a> for suggesting this ultra-cool idea for recovering my data from SVK. It took me the whole of one day, but now I'm finally free, and my data is out there and safe. I'm going to use plain-old-Subversion to work against it, until and assuming I'll get the hang of hg/bzr/git/whatever.

One thing that bugged me there however, was that I couldn't find a way to copy a remote file to a different name, because the SFTP client does not support a copy operation, and because I could not get to a login shell by sshing my rsync.net account. Apparently, it's doable and not very hard.</p><p>What you need to do is type <code>ssh my_account@somewhere.rsync.net cp [source filename] [destination filename]</code> and it will run the remote UNIX "cp" command to copy the file. You can access some other remote UNIX commands like that such as "ls".</p><p>Hope it helps.</p></div><div class="entry" id="tech-tip-disabling-tmux-time-display-in-the-status"><!-- Tags: tech tip, tech, tip

--><h2>2008-10-19: Three Tips: Perl with Vim, Subversion Problem and mailto: links in Firefox</h2><p>First of all, <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">my home-site's</a> back and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewjxzSGmOGw">you're gonna be in trouble</a>! Otherwise, this entry contains three technical tips that I collected recently:</p><ol><li><p><b>Perl and Vim</b> - sometimes one encounters a case where he needs to handle many errors in his Perl script. I encountered a similar case, when I had to work on a script that was written without "use strict;" and "use warnings;" and shouted at me senselessly when I added them.</p><p>To greatly help with that install <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=556">perl-support</a>, and look at its Perl → Run menu - there's "update, run script" (Ctrl+F9) and "update, check syntax) (Alt+F9) there which place the errors in the quickfix buffer and allow to quickly navigate them.</p></li><li><p><b>Subversion and Apache</b> - I recently encountered this error when trying to <b>mkdir</b> the first directory in an empty <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> repository, that was served using Apache:</p><pre>
shlomi:~$ svn mkdir -m "Creating TO-DEL trunk" http://localhost:8080/svn/TO-DEL/trunk
svn: OPTIONS of '/svn/TO-DEL': 200 OK (http://localhost:8080)
shlomi:~$
</pre><p>This surprised me because my client was up-to-date and the service used the same libraries, and it worked with other repositories. As it turned out the problem was that the Location entry in Apache's <code>httpd.conf</code> looks like this:</p><pre>
&lt;Location /svn/TO-DEL/&gt;
    DAV svn
    SVNPath /var/svn/TO-DEL
&lt;/Location&gt;
</pre><p>The problem here is that <code>/svn/TO-DEL/</code> in the "Location" tag has a trailing slash which confuses Subversion. Eliminating that issue solves the problem.</p></li><li><b>Firefox and mailto</b> - if "mailto:" and other non-"http:" links stopped working in Firefox, make sure that <a href="http://noscript.net/">NoScript</a> is upgraded to the latest version. There were problems with some recent versions that broke "mailto:", "ed2k:", etc.</li></ol></div><div class="entry" id="firefox-tip-disabling-drag-and-drop-previews"><h2>2008-10-10: Firefox Tip: Disabling the Drag &amp; Drop Previews</h2><!-- Tags: firefox, disable, cancel, disabling, cancelling, images, previews, drag and drop, tip, tech tip

It happened with all user accounts on the system, including new ones and was not fixed by upgrades. Furthermore, other people who used Cooker did not have it.</p><p>Well, today I finally found <a href="https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=43956#c11">a solution</a>. Apparently, some of my font directories, contained symbolic links to themselves, which confused fontconfig and caused it to scan them times and again.</p><p>To fix the problem, run <code>strace -e open -o fontconfig.strace fc-cache -v</code>, and see if it excessively scans more and more sub-directories under the directory paths. Then move away the offending symbolic links to say <code>/usr/share/REMOVED-fonts</code>.</p><p>Now konsole starts instantly, KDE 3 apps no longer become unresponsive when the file with the unicode character, firefox stalls less, and font zoom there is faster. I'm finally happy again.</p></div><div class="entry" id="shell-variable-injection"><h2>2008-09-18: Shell Variable Injection</h2><!-- Tags: shell, injection, bash, ksh, zsh, sh, unix, security, tip, technical tip, tech tip, tech, foss, linux, guysoft, safety, variable, variables
--><p><a href="http://www.zulo.org.il/blogs/guysoft/88/">GuySoft writes in his blog about Unix shell commands to convert video</a>. In the shell commands, he expands variablse like <code>-srate 22050 $infile -o $outfile".flv"</code>, without putting them inside double-quotes. In this post, I'd like to demonstrate why this is so dangerous.</p><p>When the shell expands a regular variable outside quotes it breaks into words separated by whitespace and then evaluates every word separately. To use a variable as a single token, one must enclose it inside double-quotes: <code>"$MY_VARIABLE"</code>.</p><p>Now, let's demonstrate what can happen when we don't do it properly. I'm in the home directory of a user called "shelltest on my machine". Let's see what we have there:</p><pre>

#!/bin/sh
mkdir -p $HOME/Backup
cp $1 $HOME/Backup/
rm $1
[shelltest@telaviv1 ~]$
</pre><p>We have the populated "Freecell-Solver" directory, and a shell script called "test-shell-injection.sh" that uses $1 (its first positional argument) unsafely.</p><p>Now let's abuse it:</p><pre>
[shelltest@telaviv1 ~]$ ./test-shell-injection.sh "-fr $HOME/Freecell-Solver"

drwx------ 3 shelltest shelltest 28 2008-09-18 14:07 tmp/
[shelltest@telaviv1 ~]$
</pre><p>Voila! Freecell-Solver is gone. I could have also said <code>./test-shell-injection.sh "-fr $HOME"</code> to delete the home directory. If the script does something like <code>for I in * ; do ... # Something with $I .. done</code>, then a malicious user can supply a file called "-fr $HOME" (where $HOME is the value of the home directory) in the input to delete the home directory.</p><p>In short: when writing shell scripts, always enclose variable expansion in double quotes, unless you are certain that they don't contain whitespace (which implies that you generated them yourselves), or you want to use them as a list (which also requires that you generated them yourselves).</p></div><div class="entry" id="dumping-svn-history-google-code"><h2>2008-09-16: Tip: Dumping the History of Google Code's (or any Remote) Subversion Repositories</h2><!-- Tags: tip, technical tip, tech tip, subversion, dump, history, svnsync, google, code, google code, hacking, open source, foss, tech

I have written a Website Meta Language API that allows one to generate a table of contents for the page based on them. However, recently I also looked for a way to have a link to their anchors somewhere close to them.</p><p>I eventually decided to try doing it using JavaScript and <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. It took me a bit of information lookup, trial and error and consulting people on IRC, but I ended up with:</p><pre>
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
&lt;!--
$("h1[id],h2[id],h3[id],h4[id],h5[id],h6[id]").each(
function(i){
$(this).append( ' &lt;span class="selfl"&gt;[&lt;a href="#' +
this.id + '"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;' )
})
--&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre><p>Now for some explanations:</p><ol><li>The <code>$("h1[id]...")</code> construct selects all the headings with id's. There may be a shorter way to do it (comments are welcome.</li><li>The each method iterates over all of them and calls the closure inside. The closure sets the "<code>this</code>" variable to the current element, and accepts its index there (the "i" variable). In our case, we're not making use of the index.</li><li>$(this) constructs a jQuery object from "this".</li><li>.append() appends an expression to the inner HTML of the element. I add a little HTML there. <code>this.id</code> may result in an XSS attack if you have a really funky (and probably invalid) ID, but since I have control over my ID's it's ok.</li></ol><p>You can see the result, in the headings of <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/">the presentations' page</a> (for example), as long as you don't have JavaScript turned off. jQuery seems very nice, and I'm looking forward to making even more use of it where appropriate.</p></div><div class="entry" id="handling-repetitive-qs"><!-- Tags: questions,customer,support,feedback,git,version,control,revision,scm,better,joel,software,spolsky,tip,tech,tech tip
--><h2>2008-04-08: Handling Repetitive Questions Once and for All</h2><p>Back when I worked on <a href="http://fc-solve.berlios.de/">Freecell Solver</a> , I used to prepare binary distributions of the command line solver. Now it acted as a filter, and when invoked without arguments it just waited for standard input. As a result, when the Windows users double-clicked the fc-solve.exe executable, it just popped an empty console, which they couldn't understand what to do. And a lot of them sent me a "How do I use this" program email with the exact description.</p><p>Since I became annoyed of it, I decided to output the following to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_streams#Standard_error_.28stderr.29">standard error</a> by default:</p><pre>
Reading the board from the standard input.
Type "fc-solve --help" for more usage information.
To cancel this message set the FREECELL_SOLVER_QUIET environment variable.
</pre><p>After the poor Winnies read it, it probably made them decide the program was not for them and to look for an alternative, but at least most of the emails I received about it stopped.</p><p>A year ago, Joel on Software published an article about having <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">remarkable customer services</a>, in which he said that one needs to fix everything two ways: first by helping the user, and then by making sure other users don't encounter and complain about the problem again by tweaking the behaviour. As one can see, what I did for Freecell Solver was essentially what Joel advised to do. (Albeit much later than I incorporated the fix.).</p><p>More recently, I started the <a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/">Better SCM site</a>, which compares and advocates several version control systems. However, git has been absent due to the fact a suitable maintainer did not come forward. And as a result, I received many emails asking "Where's git?". A few days ago I decided to add <a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/faq/">a Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.) to the site</a> where I answered this and other questions. However, today I received another email with "Git?" in the subject about that.</p><p>Another thing Joel had said is that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/uibook/chapters/fog0000000062.html">"People Don't Read"</a> or at least read very selectively. So I added a <a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/alternatives/git/">placeholder page about git</a> with explanation why it is absent and a call for help, and added it to <a href="http://better-scm.berlios.de/comparison/">the comparison</a> with the text "Unknown. Due to a lack of a maintainer for this system." with a link to the F.A.Q..</p><p>This should be enough to get rid of that particularly repetitive stream of emails, and hopefully will also yield me a contributor to add a better solution. Often designing web-sites and doing "customer service" (or feedback) requires designing the site properly based on the feedback one gets.</p><p>I didn't particularly think of what Joel said when I decided to do what I did with the F.A.Q. and the placeholders, but now that I think of it, I guess he was right.</p></div><div class="entry" id="eclipse-tip-remote-gdb"><!-- Tags: eclipse, gdb, gdbserver, server, tcp, client, remote, debugging, debugger, c/c++, ide, tip, linux, tech, tech tip

To close a viewport use <code>Ctrl+W,C</code>.</p><p><code>Ctrl+W,r</code> rotates the windows, and <code>Ctrl+W, shift+R</code> rotates them in the opposite direction. Finally, <code>Ctrl+W,+</code> and <code>Ctrl+W,-</code> increase and decrease the height of the viewport by one line (in case you are mouse-deprived). If that's too little you can do something like <code>10,Ctrl+W,+</code> to increase the height by 10 lines.</p></div><div class="entry" id="my-homesite-and-murphy"><!-- Tags: tidy, html, html tidy, whitespace, eliminating, tip, tech, tech tip, tips, wml, website meta language, mandriva, bug, bugs, ttml, cpan, rpm, cpan2dist, make, optimization, web design, javascript
--><h2>2008-03-23: My Homesite and Murphy</h2><p>So yesterday I decided that <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">my homesite</a>'s markup may have had too much extraneous whitespace. So I looked at <a href="http://tidy.sourceforge.net/">HTML Tidy</a> to try to remove it. I searched for a way to tell it to remove whitespace on the Net, but most pages I found only said it was possible, but didn't say how. After some trial and error I found that this <code>tidy.rc</code> file:</p><pre>
indent: 0
indent-attributes: no
vertical-space: no
wrap: 0
indent-spaces: 0
break-before-br: 0
tab-size: 0

</pre><p>And a command line that specifies it with <code>-config</code> worked the best. It still left a lot of newlines, which could be removed, but I guess it's better than nothing.</p><p>While running it, I discovered that it complained about having empty files. And I checked that the files generated were indeed empty. Then I experienced with <a href="http://thewml.org/">Website Meta Language</a> (or WML) on Mandriva and found out that piping into it even simple documents resulted in empty results.</p><p>I found out that <a href="https://qa.mandriva.com/show_bug.cgi?id=39253">the update with the fix for the WML CVE issue broke WML</a>. So I had to found out what the problem was generate a better patch and submit it. As it turns out the WML test suite still failed, but it didn't cause the RPM "%check" target to fail for some reason. After my fix, all tests passed again.</p><p>Then I was able to process the pages again. So back to tidy. Tidy still complained about some stuff like missing "summary" attributes in "table" tags. Sometimes, it exited with an error status without emitting any warnings or errors, so I had to tell my build system to skip these offending files.</p><p>So tidy ran, but it wasn't the end of my problems. When trying to build the homepage to run tidy with a clean copy, I found out that <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Template-Preprocessor-TTML/">TTML</a> did not run. This was caused by the upgrade to perl-5.10.0, and I looked for a way to prepare an up-to-date RPM out of it again. Both cpan2rpm and <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Ovid/">Ovid</a> (the Perl module, not the Perl author) failed, and so I looked into cpan2dist. After experimenting with it a bit I got it running using <a href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS-Dist-Mdv/">CPANPLUS-Dist-Mdv</a> and it gave me a working RPM. Now I'd like to prepare an equivalent package for constructing Fedora RPMs.</p><p>That was not the end of my problems. When I tried to clean-build my site, I found out that the directory structure did not get built before some of the targets. So I had to play with the make targets. Afterwards, everything went fine. The difference that tidy made was:</p><pre>
Before size: 4903322
After size: 4781819
</pre><p>What next? On the site I still have many links that start with "./". This prefix is completely redundant, and I can save some bandwidth by eliminating them. I also contemplated converting the navigation menus to JavaScript, which will read the menus' contents from the site in JSON format. Now that I think about it, the problem with this approach is that it will hinder navigating the site by web-crawlers, and may diminish the Page Rank of the various pages. It also won't work on clients which have JavaScript disabled. One thing I can do is also generate an HTML file with the current view of the navigation menu for each page and link to it directly for JavaScript-challenged clients. I still have to think about it.</p></div><div class="entry" id="vim-tip-fixing-left-right-win-switch"><!-- Tags: vim, tip, tech, tech tip, switching, window, movement, left, right, ctrl+w, c-w
--><h2>2008-02-25: Vim Tip: Fixing the Left/Right Window Switching</h2><p>My Vim tips column could use a more comprehensive entry about window management (a.k.a "split view") in Vim, but this is a small tip in this regard, that bothered me for a long time and that I want to record for prosperity and share.</p><p>When having a verticla split, one can use Ctrl+W,Left or Ctrl+W,H to move to the left split, and Ctrl+W,Right or Ctrl+W,L to move to the right split. However, it seems that for some reason Ctrl+W,Ctrl+Left (while holding the control) does not work. To fix it, add the following lines to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p><pre>
" mapping to be able to move to the left and the right windows
" without needing to leave the Ctrl key.
map &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-Right&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;Right&gt;
map &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;C-Left&gt; &lt;C-W&gt;&lt;Left&gt;
</pre><p>I've been annoyed by this behaviour for a long time, and now the salvation feels sweet. I should note that other Ctrl+W,Ctrl+Someting key-combinations work perfectly, so this aliasing is not needed there.</p></div><div class="entry" id="tech-tip-recording-tcp-sessions-to-a-file"><!--

Just add all the users that should be able to play sound at all times to the "audio" UNIX group in the "/etc/group" file (as root, of course). Then, you may have to run "sg" or "newgrp" for these changes to take effect globally.</p><p>Then you can play sound as all the users you've su'ed to that belong to the "audio" group. Also see <a href="http://archives.mandrivalinux.com/cooker/2008-01/msg00311.php">this thread in the Mandriva Cooker mailing list</a>, where I asked the question originally.</p><p>And a more obscure and less useful tip: to exclude dependencies ("requires") on different RPMs (that are calculated implicitly) when editing an Mandriva SPEC use a statement like that:</p><pre>

A net-friend who checked it got different results, and commented as well.</p><p>One thing I noticed about the Last.fm player is that it allows one to play any arbitrary Last.fm tag, while Amarok only has a set of pre-defined tags for common music genres in its GUI. However, after experimenting with "dcop" I found out one can enqueue any arbitrary Last.fm tag using the following shell script:</p><pre>
#!/bin/bash
tag="$1"
shift
dcop amarok playlist addMedia "lastfm://globaltags/${tag}"
</pre><p>To use it save as "lasttfm-amarok-tag", make it executable (<code>chmod +x</code>) and do <code>./lastfm-amarok-tag "new age"</code> to play the "new age" tag. You can also type a command line like <code>dcop amarok playlist addMedia "lastfm://globaltags/reggae"</code> directly from the command line, but that's not very convenient.</p><p>And finally, here's a recommendation for a puzzle game I saw <a href="http://freegamer.blogspot.com/2008/01/making-sounds-building-models-playing.html">mentioned on the Free Gamer blog</a>: <a href="http://packages.debian.org/lenny/hex-a-hop">Hex-a-Hop</a>.

Host berlios

Until now, I've used something like: <code>${IGLU_USERNAME:-$(whoami)}@iglu.org.il:</code>, which retrieved the value of the <code>$IGLU_USERNAME</code> and defaulted to the local user. However, now one can simply use <code>iglu.org.il:</code> or <code>mytask.iglu.org.il:</code> and define the appropriate user in the ssh config file.</p><p>Credit is due to a <a href="http://elcuco.blogli.co.il/archives/132">blog post by Diego Iastrubni</a>, where he blogged about this feature.

--><h2>2007-07-07: Vim Tip: Copying Some Non-Adjacent Lines to a Register</h2><p>Here's a vim tip on how to copy some non adjacent lines to a register (<code>"r</code>), but first the story that made me find out about how to do it exactly. I need to add full POD (Perl's documentation format) coverage to a Perl module I inherited. What it means is that every top-level function (or at least those that do not start with a "_") should have their own entries. In Perl the function definitions goes like that:</p><pre>
sub first_function {

}

sub second_function {

}

sub yet_another_function {

}
</pre><p>Etc. So I thought that I could look for all the lines that start with "sub " , collect them and append them to a register, where I'll paste them. I recalled the <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/repeat.html#:g">:g/re/$cmd</a> that executes a command on all lines matching a certain regex, and the fact that I could append to a register instead of setting its value using a yank command.</p><p>So after a little research I tried: <code>:g/^sub /"Fyy</code>. <code>:g</code> searches for the /^sub / and invokes the command on every occurence, and "Fyy, appends the current line to the register "f". However, as it turns out <code>:g</code> executes an <b>Ex command</b>. However, fear not - after a little research, I recalled the <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/various.html#:normal">:normal command</a> that allows to execute normal mode commands from within the command-line (or Ex) mode.</p><p>So the final line that works is <code>:g/^sub /normal "Fyy</code>. You may need to do <code>:let @f = ''</code> before that to clear the "f" register.</p><p>Cheers.</p></div><div class="entry" id="vip-tip-completing-lines"><!-- Tags: tip, tech, tech tip, vim

For example, "Ctrl+X ; Ctrl+L" completes entire line. So if you have a lot of <code>my $self = shift;</code> or <code>my ($self, $args) = @_;</code> in your Perl code you can start writing that line and press Ctrl+X;Ctrl+L to fill the rest of them.</p><p>Ctrl+X;Ctrl+F completes filenames, and there are other completions like that. I found it while reading <a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_24.html">usr_24 - inserting quickly</a> which contains some other tips.
