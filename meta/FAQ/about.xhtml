I have a Bachelor of Sciences (B.Sc.) from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology">Technion</a> in Electrical Engineering, but it would be a stretch to call me an Electrical Engineer, at least with my current level of expertise in the field. I&#8217;m actually more of a programmer and a specialised mathematician.</p><p>At the moment, I&#8217;m a computer geek (= person who is enthusiastic about computers), and a former nerd (= a person without a social life), because I recently started to increasingly socialise more. I&#8217;m interested in many other fields, including linguistics, history, writing, children and non-children literature, and T.V. and movies.</p><p>I should note that I am only <b>one</b> person, and in fact am unaware of any other &#8220;Shlomi Fish&#8221;&#8217;es of significance (at least not according to Internet searches).</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="guy_or_girl">Are you a Guy or a Girl?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="guy_or_girl.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>I am very much a guy, despite what my first name&#8217;s suffix (the &#8220;i&#8221; of &#8220;Shlom<b>i</b>&#8221;) may imply to English speakers. I am also (mostly) heterosexual, but I hate being a macho in real-life, and have some other qualities that are considered somewhat feminine. However, I do not think I&#8217;m a woman born in a man&#8217;s body. (Or a lesbian born in a man&#8217;s body, for that matter.)</p><p>Many Israeli masculine names end with an &#8220;i&#8221;: Avi, Ari, Meni, Beni, Ori, Uri, Udi, Eli, etc. An &#8220;i&#8221; suffix means &#8220;of me&#8221; or &#8220;mine&#8221; in Hebrew, or &#8220;having the property-of&#8221; (like &#8220;-ful&#8221; in English). There are also many Israeli Hebrew feminine names that end with &#8220;i&#8221;. One reason I&#8217;m using &#8220;Shlomi&#8221; instead of &#8220;Shlomy&#8221; is because &#8220;Shlomy&#8221; might be pronounced to rhyme with the word &#8220;my&#8221;.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="your_name">What can you say about your name?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="your_name.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>Well, &#8220;Shlomi&#8221; or &#8220;&#1513;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497;&#8221; in Hebrew (see its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlomi_%28Hebrew_name%29">wikipedia entry</a>) means &#8220;my Shalom&#8221; in Hebrew, or perhaps &#8220;Shalom-ful&#8221; (= having the property of Shalom) or &#8220;the Shalom of Jehovah&#8221;. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shalom">&#8220;Shalom&#8221;</a> is an ancient Hebrew word, that is derived from <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Appendix:Proto-Semitic/%C5%A1al%C4%81m-">proto-Semitic origins</a> meaning something like &#8220;well-being&#8221;, &#8220;welfare&#8221;, "harmony", "wholeness", even "prosperity" - not only &#8220;peace&#8221;. It is an ambiguous noun as the nouns of some ancient Semitic languages were. See also <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/42172.html">what I wrote about it on my blog</a> (and some of the comments I received).</p><p>True to my name, I often feel that I have "more luck than brains" (as hard as it is to believe given many smart people consider me very smart) and while enduring some hardships (including physical ones!) was often at the right place at the right time (including on a certain Internet/television/etc. forum or resource) and came up on top.</p><p>Moreover, just like <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15887/jewish/Chapter-3.htm">king Solomon in the bible</a>, I wanted to be kind, good hearted, and benevolent as a child by inspiration from fairy tales I read or listened to.</p><p>The reason why it is &#8220;Shlomi&#8221; or &#8220;Shelomi&#8221; instead of &#8220;Shalomi&#8221; is due to a certain pronunciation transformation in Hebrew, where certain vowels are shortened into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shwa">Shwa</a> when they are distanced too much from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28linguistics%29">Stress</a> of the word. Quite a few non-Hebrew speakers have issues with pronouncing Hebrew words that start with several Shwas in succession (as <a href="../../humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#is-moshes-ben-amram-the-jewish-prophet">this scene</a> from a screenplay I wrote indicates).</p><p>Now, most Israelis pronounce this name with the stress on the &#8220;lo&#8221;. I, however prefer it to be pronounced with the stress on the &#8220;mi&#8221;, albeit I also answer to people who pronounce it the other way around. My version is the correct Biblical pronunciation. You can hear me pronounce it in <b>Hebrew</b> (<a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-Hebrew.ogg">Ogg</a>, <a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-Hebrew.mp3">mp3</a>) and in <b>English</b> (<a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-English.ogg">Ogg</a>, <a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-English.mp3">mp3</a>).</p><p>Please spell the name as starting with &#8220;Sh&#8221;, similar to the common spelling in English &#8212; not with &#8220;Sch&#8221; (the German spelling).</p><p>My last name - Fish - naturally means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish">the aquatic organisms</a> in English or (with a different spelling) in German. It was the last name of my late grandfather who was a Polish-born Jew, and I&#8217;m still carrying it.</p><p>&#8220;Fish&#8221; is an uncommon name in Israel, but there are also some variations such as &#8220;Fisher&#8221;, &#8220;Fishman&#8221;, &#8220;Fischer&#8221;, &#8220;Fishlov&#8221;, &#8220;Fishelson&#8221;, etc.</p><p>Note that the last name &#8220;Fish&#8221; is not meaningful in Hebrew and in fact in Ancient Hebrew the only possible pronunciation would be &#8220;Pish&#8221; (which means &#8220;pee&#8221; or &#8220;urine&#8221; in Modern Israeli Hebrew slang) because it uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe_%28letter%29">same letter - &#1508;</a> for both the "P" and the "F" sounds, and it would be "P" in the beginning of the word.</p><section class="h4"><header><h4 id="is_shlomi_fish_your_real_name">Is Shlomi Fish Your Real Name?</h4><a class="indiv_node" href="is_shlomi_fish_your_real_name.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>Despite what the name may imply to non-Israeli people, Shlomi Fish (written as &#8220;&#1513;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#8221; in the Hebrew alphabet) is my real, and legal, name.

Later on, I decided it was a too common name, so I switched to &#8220;gloin&#8221;, the name of a different dwarf.

However, after I returned to Israel at the age of five, the children there ridiculed me for my English.

Possibly worse, I lost many of my earliest childhood memories, as I thought about them and remembered them in English.</p><p>After that, I had to regain English much more painfully as I learned it at school, and from other sources such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adventure_game">computerised Adventure games</a>, books, films, Television shows, and the Internet.</p><p>Shortly after high school, I felt that my English has dramatically improved.

Write a lot. Start a blog. Write about interesting stories from your past. Ask your readers to point to the issues in your text (also your code). Maybe start specialised blogs for writing about a topic that interests you.</p></li><li><p>Read. Read a lot. Especially fine literature, though not too archaic. I really like reading original and quality Children and Young Adult's Literature in English (e.g: The Hobbit, The Treasure Island, E. Nesbit, Roald Dahl, Mary Poppins, Sherlock Holmes). There are many public domain and freely distributable fiction online in Project Gutenberg.</p></li><li><p>Pay attention to what you write and how you phrase yourself. Don't write too hastily.</p></li><li><p>Chat with English speakers on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a> - I like <a href="https://freenode.net/">Freenode</a> for that and they have an ##English channel, but other channels accept somewhat off-topicish discussion, especially some #not-channels or channels like #perlcafe , or #perl-cats, which are intended solely for off-topic discussion.</p></li><li><p>Watch/listen to some films to see how people use the English language in speech. There are many clips on YouTube and similar sites and you can learn a lot from them. There are some larger scale videos available online, offline and on torrents naturally.</p></li><li><p>Most importantly - remember that improving your language is hard work, but it's also fun, because hard work is often fun and rewarding and makes you happy. The opposite of fun and pleasure in general is not necessarily work.
