Furthermore, I recommend thinking that you can "save the world" or at least change or improve it. Moreover, you can enjoy the world, and improve yourself and everyone else at the same time.</p><p>Note that there are still real command structures: your family, your superiors or bosses, your military commanders, your government, your customers and/or users (or your service providers), your friends, etc. If what they request you to do seems reasonable and beneficial, you should dedicate time to perform it <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/">in the best, "Rosh Gadol"-manner</a>.</p><p>That put aside, blindly following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">superior orders</a> is wrong, and you may wish to refuse an order, if it seems immoral or unethical. And like the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Quick_and_the_Dead_(1995_film)">The Quick and the Dead</a> notes one should not be "afraid to live": voice your opinion, whether approving or disapproving, offline or online. HR drones who try to find faults in your online presence are going to be unhappy anyway, and from my impression they are usually wilfully stupid and thus quite evil and misguided.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
