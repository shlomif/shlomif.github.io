My father, on the other hand, was born in Israel to a mother from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius">Vilnius</a> (a.k.a &#8220;The Jerusalem of Lithuania&#8221;) who immigrated to the British mandate of Palestine, along with most of her family, during the 1930s, and to a father who was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw">Warsaw, Poland</a>, and who escaped from the Nazis during World War II through the USSR, and Persia/Iran.</p><p>As such, I look (see <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shlomif/14537790923/in/photostream/">photo</a>) like a kind of a Iraqi/Persian version of my father, who looks East European.</p><p>A conversation I took part in the evening during a hiking trip, went something like that:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Girl to Shlomif: "which Jewry do you belong to?"</p></li><li><p>Shlomif: "I am half-Polish / half-Iraqi."</p></li><li><p>Girl to her male friend with me overhearing it: "You know what is the only thing that is worse than a Polish Jew? A half-Polish / half-Iraqi!"</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>I found it amusing, and kind-of have taken it to my advantage.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
