I used to get into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression">Clinical depressions</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression#Anxiety">anxieties</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression#Hypomania">Hypomanias</a> and even a few <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania">Manias</a>. The presence of the latter may indicate I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Bipolar Disorder</a> (or &#8220;Mania-Depressia&#8221;).</p><p>I&#8217;m no longer getting into depressions or anxieties, which is good because when I&#8217;m in them, I feel that I am a bad person, think the whole world is bad and cannot concentrate on doing anything. I&#8217;m still getting some hypomanias, in which I feel quite elevated, while in fact knowing that I feel bad, and where I can still function, and still know that I&#8217;m a good person. Most of the time, I am OK.</p><p>Note that the opinions I express and what I say are not a consequence of my mental status, but rather of the <a href="../../philosophy/books-recommends/">many philosophical influences</a>, I&#8217;ve been exposed to, which I feel made my thinking process straighter and more logical. Some people take many common &#8220;truisms&#8221; for granted, but I can often demonstrate they are wrong.</p><p>Here are a few jokes about it:</p><blockquote><p>Shlomi Fish once defined himself as a &#8220;Programmer, Writer, Amateur Mathematician, Wannabe Philosopher, and someone who studied in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology">Technion</a> in the vain hope of becoming an Electrical Engineer&#8221;. He does not consider himself a sane person, but is quite certain that only makes him more interesting.</p></blockquote><p>Also <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=becoming-crazy">this Freenode chat:</a></p><pre>
  &lt;tyler-&gt;  rindolf: you are seriously the craziest fucker I know
  &lt;tyler-&gt;  and I know some crazy ass people
  &lt;mofino&gt;  haha
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  tyler-: I am crazy. And proud of it.
  &lt;tyler-&gt;  rindolf: you should be
  &lt;mofino&gt;  haha
  &lt;mofino&gt;  Ahh man
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  tyler-: being crazy is hard work. I worked all my life to be
            crazy.
  &lt;mofino&gt;  Normal people aren&#8217;t fun.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  tyler-: &#8220;Craziness is not an action. It&#8217;s a process.&#8221;
  &lt;mofino&gt;  heh
  &lt;tyler-&gt;  rindolf: I see
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  You need to tend to your insanity.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  tyler-: do you want to be crazy?
  &lt;tyler-&gt;  rindolf: that&#8217;s why I feed my leprechaun at least once a
            day.
 &lt;rindolf&gt;  tyler-: I can teach you everything I know.
</pre><p>(and &#8220;Ask not what your insanity can do for you - ask what you can do for your insanity.&#8221;)</p><p>My opinions are subject to change - they have changed in the past, and it&#8217;s likely they will change again. Furthermore, reality is dynamic, and Ethics, philosophy and opinions change with time, as technology, culture and education progresses.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
