It is an ambiguous noun as the nouns of some ancient Semitic languages were. See also <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/42172.html">what I wrote about it on my blog</a> (and some of the comments I received).</p><p>True to my name, I often feel that I have "more luck than brains" (as hard as it is to believe given many smart people consider me very smart) and while enduring some hardships (including physical ones!) was often at the right place at the right time (including on a certain Internet/television/etc. forum or resource) and came up on top.</p><p>Moreover, just like <a href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/15887/jewish/Chapter-3.htm">king Solomon in the bible</a>, I wanted to be kind, good hearted, and benevolent as a child by inspiration from fairy tales I read or listened to.</p><p>The reason why it is &#8220;Shlomi&#8221; or &#8220;Shelomi&#8221; instead of &#8220;Shalomi&#8221; is due to a certain pronunciation transformation in Hebrew, where certain vowels are shortened into a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shwa">Shwa</a> when they are distanced too much from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_%28linguistics%29">Stress</a> of the word. Quite a few non-Hebrew speakers have issues with pronouncing Hebrew words that start with several Shwas in succession (as <a href="../../humour/Selina-Mandrake/ongoing-text.html#is-moshes-ben-amram-the-jewish-prophet">this scene</a> from a screenplay I wrote indicates).</p><p>Now, most Israelis pronounce this name with the stress on the &#8220;lo&#8221;. I, however prefer it to be pronounced with the stress on the &#8220;mi&#8221;, albeit I also answer to people who pronounce it the other way around. My version is the correct Biblical pronunciation. You can hear me pronounce it in <b>Hebrew</b> (<a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-Hebrew.ogg">Ogg</a>, <a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-Hebrew.mp3">mp3</a>) and in <b>English</b> (<a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-English.ogg">Ogg</a>, <a href="sounds/How-I-pronounce-Shlomi-Fish-English.mp3">mp3</a>).</p><p>Please spell the name as starting with &#8220;Sh&#8221;, similar to the common spelling in English &#8212; not with &#8220;Sch&#8221; (the German spelling).</p><p>My last name - Fish - naturally means <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish">the aquatic organisms</a> in English or (with a different spelling) in German. It was the last name of my late grandfather who was a Polish-born Jew, and I&#8217;m still carrying it.</p><p>&#8220;Fish&#8221; is an uncommon name in Israel, but there are also some variations such as &#8220;Fisher&#8221;, &#8220;Fishman&#8221;, &#8220;Fischer&#8221;, &#8220;Fishlov&#8221;, &#8220;Fishelson&#8221;, etc.</p><p>Note that the last name &#8220;Fish&#8221; is not meaningful in Hebrew and in fact in Ancient Hebrew the only possible pronunciation would be &#8220;Pish&#8221; (which means &#8220;pee&#8221; or &#8220;urine&#8221; in Modern Israeli Hebrew slang) because it uses the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pe_%28letter%29">same letter - &#1508;</a> for both the "P" and the "F" sounds, and it would be "P" in the beginning of the word.</p><section class="h4"><header><h4 id="is_shlomi_fish_your_real_name">Is Shlomi Fish Your Real Name?</h4><a class="indiv_node" href="is_shlomi_fish_your_real_name.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>Despite what the name may imply to non-Israeli people, Shlomi Fish (written as &#8220;&#1513;&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1497; &#1508;&#1497;&#1513;&#8221; in the Hebrew alphabet) is my real, and legal, name.
