By some peer pressure, I tried reading it again in high school, and stopped in the middle of the first volume.</p><p>I strongly suspect that if it were written using <a href="./#why_real_person_fiction">fan fiction</a> characters (e.g: Sauron &#8594; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal">Ashurbanipal</a> ; Gandalf &#8594; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses">Moses</a> ; Frodo &#8594; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David">David</a> ), it would be better in many ways: more memorable, shorter, funnier, more fun, and with a more effective message.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion"><i>The Silmarillion</i></a> - was OK but I do not remember most of the plot (and do not care enough to).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer_Giles_of_Ham">Farmer Giles of Ham</a> was incredibly funny, succinct, and memorable. I may gladly read it again sometimes.</p></li><li><p>The film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring"><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i></a> could have been more enjoyable if the cinema my father and I watched it on would have provided an intermission, because by the end of its 3 hours we really had to pee. (Re <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/23596.html">Alfred Hitchcock's quote</a>.)</p><p>My father and other family (but not I) have watched the other two films on DVD at home, which was easily capable of being paused and sought. I do enjoy the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/one-does-not-simply-walk-into-mordor">"One does not simply"</a> snowclone, however.</p></li></ol><img src="../../humour/images/one-does-not-simply-read-tolkiens-lotr-600.webp" alt="One does not simply read Tolkien&#8217;s Lord of the Rings"/></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
