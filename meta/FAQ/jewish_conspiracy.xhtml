Moreover, some of my teachers at high school criticised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">the book</a> as deceitful anti-semitic material. You may, however, opt to believe I'm being kept out of the loop, or that I&#8217;m lying. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnord">Fnord!</a>. You didn't see that, right? &#128521;)</p><p>It is true that in some of my stories I featured a conspiracy of <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">&#8220;vampires&#8221;</a> (= "hackers" or "geeks"), which were in fact the good guys in history, and not limited to bona-fide Jews, which was inspired by this and other sources. Nonetheless, these stories are fictional, I do not take them at face value myself, and recommend others to not take them literally, either (even though they may have implications and convey some lessons about the real world).</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
