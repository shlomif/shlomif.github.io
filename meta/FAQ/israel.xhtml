Reading from it:</p><blockquote><p>Seems like "anti-Zionism" is broadly defined (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-Zionism">Anti-Zionism</a> ) just as "Zionism" is poorly defined. I'm Jewish and live in Israel and oppose the by-laws discrimination against non-Jews/Jews/whatever.

I am a Hebrew speaker and reader/writer, but cannot understand the spoken Arabic dialect spoken by some of the local Arab speakers, except for a few words. Note that there are many spoken Arabic dialects as well as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Standard_Arabic">Literary Arabic</a> which is common but not normally used in speech. Many Arabic speakers in Israel also know Hebrew, but native Hebrew speakers (Jews/etc.) usually do not have the motivation to learn Arabic or retain their knowledge of it.</p><p>Some other notes:</p><ol><li><p>I studied Literary Arabic for 6 years in junior high and high school and passed the 5 points matriculation exam in it. However, I lost most of my vocabulary due to lack of use, and also do not readily remember some of the grammar.</p></li><li><p>A few Arab Israelis I spoke with told me it was easier for them to learn to read and write Hebrew than it was to learn Literary Arabic, despite the fact that the local Palestinian Arabic was their mother language. This is due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diglossia">diglossia</a> present there.</p></li><li><p>If you know both English and Arabic, I can highly recommend listening to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PAgX-qf1f4">Shaike Ophir&#8217;s "The English Teacher" skit</a>.</p></li></ol></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="jewish_conspiracy">Are you aware of any Jewish &#8220;Elders of Zion&#8221; / Illuminati / &#8220;Zionist&#8221; conspiracy?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="jewish_conspiracy.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>Despite being Jewish by blood and an Israeli resident and citizen, who received secular Israeli education, I can testify that I am unaware of such a sinister conspiracy that cannot be refuted by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor">Occam&#8217;s Razor</a>. Moreover, some of my teachers at high school criticised <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Protocols_of_the_Elders_of_Zion">the book</a> as deceitful anti-semitic material. You may, however, opt to believe I'm being kept out of the loop, or that I&#8217;m lying. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fnord">Fnord!</a>.

Nonetheless, these stories are fictional, I do not take them at face value myself, and recommend others to not take them literally, either (even though they may have implications and convey some lessons about the real world).</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="are_you_an_agent">Are you a Mossad / Shin Bet / Unit 8200 / NSA / Hizbullah / CIA / etc. agent?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="are_you_an_agent.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>I can testify that I am just an unemployed Israeli and secular Jewish web-writer and software developer.

I am a sloppy software developer and was far sloppier back then, but they still wanted to hire me.
