The reason I&#8217;m serving them as <code>text/html</code> is because <a href="../../no-ie/">Microsoft Internet Explorer</a> does not handle <code>application/xml+xhtml</code> properly, and I&#8217;d rather not needlessly discriminate against people who still use it (possibly against their will).</p><p>I realise that it stands against the XHTML standard, but I&#8217;m not a standards purist, and want to be a bit pragmatic in still supporting Explorer. Note that some pages in the <a href="../../MathVentures/">Math-Ventures section</a> end with the <code>.xhtml</code> suffix and are served as XHTML because they contain <a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">MathML</a>.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
