Now what I do with them:</p><ol><li id="brown_solid_d10"><p><a href="../../me/rindolf/images/brown-1d10-SGlau-LARGE.jpg"><img src="../../me/rindolf/images/brown-1d10-SGlau-scaled.jpg" alt="My ten-sided-die &#8220;Schwartz&#8221; ring/amulet of power" class="faq_float"/></a>After I donated my role-playing gear to a local role-playing club that my friends ran, I was given <a href="../../me/rindolf/images/brown-1d10-SGlau-LARGE.jpg">a plain brown 1d10 die</a> that my friends at the time (~1997ish) allowed me to take. I carried it in my pencil case, and it became a symbolic object and feel it brought me a lot of good luck and bad luck (which are often <a href="http://www.naute.com/inspiration/luck.phtml">two sides of the same coin</a>).</p><p>Now, however, I decided to give it to <a href="../../humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/">Ms. Summer Glau</a> (who is a Hollywood actress, but much more than that for me), and it is now her property, which I intend to officially pass it along to her and see what she will decide to do with it.</p></li><li><p>I also buy d10s in large quantities (went up to 10 packs of 10 purple translucent d10 dice each from <a href="http://www.thedicestoreonline.com/">The Dice Shop</a>) and offer to give them away to people I interact with in real life (IRL), such as vendors, clerks and sellers in shops. While not everyone accepts them, many people do.</p></li><li><p><a href="../../me/rindolf/images/rpg-dice-set--on-nuc.webp"><img src="../../me/rindolf/images/rpg-dice-set--on-nuc--thumb.webp" alt="My set of role-playing games dice" class="faq_float"/></a>Following the transition from <a href="../../humour/Selina-Mandrake/">Selina Mandrake</a> to <a href="../../humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">Summerschool at the NSA</a>, I bought a complete set of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">Tabletop role-playing games</a>' dice, and use it as a symbolic object. This is its photo after being placed on my NUC computer along with <a href="./#brown_solid_d10">the 1d10 die</a> that I have given to Summer Glau.</p></li></ol></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
