The word "selfishness" does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. &#8230;As with selflessness, selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational behavior -- a form of stupid behavior.</p></blockquote><p>( There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness#Use_of_the_term_selfishness">similar sentiments by others</a> referenced on the book's Wikipedia page. )</p><p>While I&#8217;m no longer a Neo-Tech purist, I still agree with them that both selfish and selfless (= having an irrational disregard for one&#8217;s self) behaviours should be avoided as much as possible, and that one should strive for &#8220;Rational Self-Growth&#8221; and that often &#8220;selfish vs. selfless&#8221; is presented as a false dichotomy.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
