Why not Hebrew?</h3><a class="back_to_faq" href="./#website_in_english">Node Link</a></header><p>For several reasons:</p><ol><li>There are many more English speakers (either as their mother tongue or as a secondary language) than Hebrew speakers. So I&#8217;m reaching a bigger target audience by writing in English.</li><li>Most native Hebrew speakers (i.e: Israelis) can read English well enough to understand my English writing. So most of the target audience for writing stuff in Hebrew will benefit from it very little.</li><li>I find it more comfortable and faster to type in English and express myself in writing using English for most types of writing (some <a href="../../humour/">stories I&#8217;m writing</a> being an exception).</li><li>I often use a lot of tech jargon or slang, which is more difficult to translate to Hebrew.</li></ol><p>That put aside, if you wish to translate a piece I wrote to any other language (including Hebrew), feel free to do so. I contributed some Hebrew translations to some English articles that other people originated, and also translated some things I wrote in Hebrew to English.</p><p>Note that <b>I&#8217;m using Commonwealth English</b> on this site. Partly because I think that&#8217;s what Israelis are supposed to use, partly because I have been somewhat British-oriented, and partly because it feels nicer to use an uncommon spelling. I am still using US English spelling for source code and for technical documents, though.</p><p>My thoughts are that both the British spelling and the American spelling (and their common subset), are inconsistent and confusing, but I have to make a choice of some sort.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
