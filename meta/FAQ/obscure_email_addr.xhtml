That&#8217;s because they also install a lot of malware on vulnerable computers to harvest email addresses from. Since I can&#8217;t refrain from sending email to Windows users, and would rather not, I can never prevent spam entirely.</p><p>I deal with spam by filtering it on the client side. I&#8217;m using <a href="../../open-source/favourite/#spamassassin">SpamAssassin</a> to filter my email and so far it&#8217;s doing a very good job. Some spam still arrives at my inbox, but otherwise very little. There are <a href="http://freecode.com/articles/view/964/">several other open-source spam filters</a> (and some non-open-source solutions), which you may wish to look at. <a href="http://gmail.com/">GMail</a> and other webmail services also do a good job in filtering spam (regardless of <a href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/46955.html">their other faults</a>).</p><p>All of that put aside, I think that having a convenient &#8220;mailto:&#8221; link is recommended because people don&#8217;t need to go through inconvenient hoops to send you an email. I love receiving (good) email about my site, and I&#8217;d rather not throw away the baby along with the water, just because spammers may have an easier time harvesting my already public email address.</p><p>For more information, see <a href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.717364.8">my post to the &#8220;Joel on Software&#8221; forum</a> about &#8220;Email at the bottom of every page&#8221;.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
