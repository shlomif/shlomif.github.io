I believe that this way I&#8217;m less tired, more energetic, and less moody. I don&#8217;t need such negative bio-physical aphrodisiacs to be happy, and neither do you.</p><p>Most of the people I talk with on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a> who consume caffeine have become dependent on it and cannot function without their morning/mid-morning/midday/etc. coffee. On the other hand, I&#8217;m energetic from the time I wake up until I go to sleep. As for alcohol, it has negative short-term and long-term effects. And I also don&#8217;t want to become drunk because it will cause me to lose control of myself, and do silly things and say silly stuff.</p><p>I have never smoked or taken drugs, and never intend to do so. People with a drug dependency reduce their happiness and self-esteem like this, and damage their health.</p><p>All that put aside, I still believe <a href="../../philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/">all these substances should be legal</a>, and should not be regulated in any way.</p><p>Note that as of November 2019, I am still taking prescribed <b>psychiatric drugs</b> which <a href="../../philosophy/psychology/why-openly-bipolar-people-should-not-be-medicated/">I hate and think are harmful</a> but am <b>forced</b> to take.</p><hr/><p>Regarding food, I eat an omnivorous diet that includes meat (chicken, beef, pork/bacon/ham/etc. and the occasional mutton) - sorry vegans/vegetarians but I feel like I need to eat meat. I used to avoid consuming sugary foods and beverages, but I now consume them again and am much happier.</p><section class="h4"><header><h4 id="geek_who_avoids_caffeine">So you avoid caffeine?

Geeks comes in many shapes and sizes (also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Fish,_Two_Fish,_Red_Fish,_Blue_Fish"><i>One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish</i></a>) and they don't always completely match the stigmatic "computer geek" archetype (e.g: <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html">A Portrait of J.
