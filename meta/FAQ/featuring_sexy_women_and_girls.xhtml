Are you a pervert?</h3><a class="back_to_faq" href="./#featuring_sexy_women_and_girls">Node Link</a></header><p>Well, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I feel that a man who is attracted to women displaying competence, sexiness, strength, etc. - however interpreted - has a healthy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido">libido (or &#8220;sex drive&#8221;)</a> rather than is a pervert, whose sexual preferences prevent him from functioning.</p><p>Anyway, do you really believe that when <a href="../../humour/bits/facts/Taylor-Swift/">Taylor Swift</a> depicted her friends and herself laying waste to a whole city in the videoclip for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_(Taylor_Swift_song)">"Bad Blood"</a> (and <a href="../../humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and similar likely showed it more than once) that they actually are indeed so violent in real life? While sometimes I felt like going on a mayhem rage when there was a lot of commotion outside when I was trying to sleep or concentrate, I didn't actually do that, and at most only ranted about it online or called the police. I believe no <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#great-hackers">great action hero</a> will ever deliberately kick a friendly cat or dog.</p><p>Furthermore, just because I write about stuff like that, does not mean I do not have enough self-control, or that I have sex with, sexually assault, or sexually harass everything that moves.</p><p>Moreover, if you think my fiction is bad, you should try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the Hebrew Bible</a> or, to a lesser extent, some of the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction">slash fiction</a> and other incest fiction that exist, and which: <b>1.</b> Many gay, lesbian, bisexual, and even trans people dislike; <b>2.</b> Its authors are often otherwise sexually healthy functioning adults.</p><hr/><p>Now regarding their <b>age</b>: yes, I'm aware that some of them are underage. However, it may seem farfetched, but I think that underage girls and boys can still be competent, both in their tangible endeavours, but also in their sexual/romantic orientation. Back at the time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin">Macaulay Culkin</a>, who was the &#8220;alpha male&#8221; of a large part of the 1990s (despite his youth), raised a few eyebrows, when marrying at the age of 18 shortly after high school graduation. However, I recently heard of a Jewish couple of a husband and wife who were 15 then (with the girl pregnant), and as scary as it sounded, it didn&#8217;t seem too horrid of a thought. Some people <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQALLGsn-Fk">learn faster than others</a>.</p><p>Just another note about Culkin: some people also criticised him for possessing Marijuana and for its use, but many young and not-so-young people I talked with have had a history of Marijuana use, or even Marijuana addiction, so I do not hold it against him. See my <a href="../../philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/">&#8220;The Case for Drug Legalisation&#8221;</a> for why Marijuana, and all other illegal narcotics, should be made legal globally.</p><hr/><p>I also have <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1505075791943589890">a hypothesis</a> that pleasure, education (learning and teaching), and creativity / conception, are closely intertwined. Since we cannot expect children to avoid having fun, or to learn, we must accept the fact that they'll have sexual experiences.</p><hr/><p>Finally, note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Nesbit">E Nesbit</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling">JK Rowling</a> both featured underage children in their books.</p><p>When PETA's twitter <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/JuHnlSY+">criticised the sexualisation of catgirls in Anime</a>, it was criticised for not going against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street"><i>Sesame Street</i></a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic"><i>My Little Pony</i></a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios_films">Disney</a> and being bullies. (Note that PETA's Twitter may have improved in this aspect since.) So please pick on someone your size, or just admit you were wrong, and choose a more worthwhile battle.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
