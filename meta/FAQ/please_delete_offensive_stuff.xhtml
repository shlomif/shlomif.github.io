I speak my mind and express myself using the words in the English language that I find appropriate and find that deliberately removing text and other content from web sites is the modern day equivalent to <a href="http://atheism.about.com/od/weeklyquotes/a/heine01.htm">burning books</a>, which as Heinrich Heine predicted eventually leads to burning people (which in modern times usually only amounts to blocking them from speaking on an Internet subforum). So I'm not going to do it unless absolutely necessary.</p><p>As noted <a href="./#political_correctness">elsewhere on this F.A.Q.</a>, I have a strong stance against political correctness fanaticism. Furthermore, as <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#trying_to_please_everybody">the old tale of &#8220;The miller, his son, and the donkey&#8221;</a> demonstrates, trying to comply with everyone's whims regarding what they disapprove of in this site, is a slippery slope, that will lead to a lot of content removed.</p><p>For more information, see:</p><ul><li><p><a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">&#8220;Encourage criticism and try to get offended&#8221;</a></p></li></ul><p>Note that I&#8217;m open to adding visible notes at the tops of individual pages with updates, corrections, or saying that I no longer approve of their content. But this is assuming I agree with them.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
