Also note that despite the fact that I am Jewish by ethnicity, and heritage, and studied (or was forced to study, although I often enjoyed it) some of the Jewish writings, and incorporated influences from it in my writing, I am not a religious or observant Jew.</p><p>All that put aside, I consider myself a self-sufficient, optimistic, idealistic and anti-cynical, pluralistic, anti-Fatalist, agnostic. Now let me explain what all those mean:</p><ul><li><p>I&#8217;m <b>agnostic</b> because I&#8217;m not sure whether God &#8212; however he/she/they/it are manifested &#8212; exists or not. I suspect they do, but don&#8217;t take chances and <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/tie_your_camel.xhtml">don&#8217;t wish to risk dying</a> - now or ever.</p></li><li><p>I&#8217;m <b>self-sufficient</b> because I believe that &#8220;The gods help those that help themselves&#8221;, that &#8220;reality to be conquered must be obeyed&#8221; and all that Jazz.</p></li><li><p>I am optimistic, idealistic and <b>anti-cynical</b> because I believe that people are inherently good, can be trusted and that humanity is going forward instead of backward. I feel like my life is gradually improving and that almost every day is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW3rK-giAaM">best day of my life</a> so far, and that 2014 (when these lines were written) is the best year I can remember (and I&#8217;m 1977-born).</p></li><li><p>I&#8217;m <b>pluralistic</b>, because I constantly have derived and will derive inspiration from <a href="../../me/rindolf/#rindolfism">many sources</a> and also try to not dismiss an insight based on its source - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">Ad-hominem</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum">Reductio ad Hitlerum</a> for more information about why this is fallacious.</p><p>Also see <a href="../../humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=larry-wall-all-truth-is-gods-truh">this quote by Larry Wall</a> about <q>All Truth is God's Truth</q>.</p></li><li><p>I am <b>anti-Fatalistic</b> because I believe that humans&#8217; survival mechanism - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason">reason</a> - operates <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/dont_just_go_with_the_flow.xhtml"><b>by choice</b></a>, and not automatically, and that we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will">free will</a>. This is as opposed to the new age crop of neo-Deterministic materialistic atheists who believe that the laws of physics dictate exactly what a person will think and do.</p><p><b>Note:</b> I was told that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism">Fatalism</a> vs. free will is a much older debate than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a> (reason operates by choice) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris">Sam Harris</a> (who reportedly used to advocate Fatalism).</p></li></ul></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="ethnicity">What is your ethnicity? What is your lineage?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="ethnicity.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>I am a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">Jew</a> by birth and almost all of my known ancestors were or are Jewish.</p><p>That put aside, my mother was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baghdad">Baghdad, Iraq</a> and lived there for some years as a child before her parents and she <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliyah">made aliyah</a> (or immigrated) to Israel. My father, on the other hand, was born in Israel to a mother from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilnius">Vilnius</a> (a.k.a &#8220;The Jerusalem of Lithuania&#8221;) who immigrated to the British mandate of Palestine, along with most of her family, during the 1930s, and to a father who was born and raised in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warsaw">Warsaw, Poland</a>, and who escaped from the Nazis during World War II through the USSR, and Persia/Iran.</p><p>As such, I look (see <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/shlomif/14537790923/in/photostream/">photo</a>) like a kind of a Iraqi/Persian version of my father, who looks East European.</p><p>A conversation I took part in the evening during a hiking trip, went something like that:</p><blockquote><ul><li><p>Girl to Shlomif: "which Jewry do you belong to?"</p></li><li><p>Shlomif: "I am half-Polish / half-Iraqi."</p></li><li><p>Girl to her male friend with me overhearing it: "You know what is the only thing that is worse than a Polish Jew? A half-Polish / half-Iraqi!"</p></li></ul></blockquote><p>I found it amusing, and kind-of have taken it to my advantage.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="secular_jew">How come you say you are a secular Jew? Isn't Judaism a religion?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="secular_jew.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jews">Judaism</a> is much more than just a religion, and it is also an ethnicity (or "peopleship" as I used to call it), a culture, a heritage, and possibly many other things. There are many secular Jews, who do not completely adhere to the Jewish religion, and are instead <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deism">deist</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agnosticism">agnostic</a> or even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheist</a>. This is <a href="./#religious_belief">the case for me</a>, but note that I am still aware of Jewish holidays, and join the family feast or reflect upon them in a way. (I also commemorate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day">April Fools' Day</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day">International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a> and some other secular holidays.)</p><p>Despite all that, my studies of the Jewish religious scripture, have a large influence on <a href="../../me/rindolf/#rindolfism">my personal philosophy "Rindolfism"</a> and my <a href="../../humour/">works of fiction</a>, but there are many other influences. As much as I like parts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Hebrew Bible</a>, I do not hold it as gospel, or as "The Word of God", and I think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sturgeon%27s_law">Sturgeon's law</a> (= "90% of everything is crap") might apply to it as well.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="how_do_you_define_yourself">How do you define yourself?

As I <a href="../../philosophy/the-eternal-jew/the-eternal-jew/define_myself.xhtml">noted in an essay</a>, I define myself as "Shlomi Fish".

The word "selfishness" does have valuable, precise denotations of "an irrational, harmful disregard for others". Rand could have strengthened her work by selecting accurate wording such as rational self-growth. Instead, she unnecessarily bent and undermined the precise, valuable meaning of selfishness. &#8230;As with selflessness, selfishness is a form of immature, destructive, irrational behavior -- a form of stupid behavior.</p></blockquote><p>( There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness#Use_of_the_term_selfishness">similar sentiments by others</a> referenced on the book's Wikipedia page. )</p><p>While I&#8217;m no longer a Neo-Tech purist, I still agree with them that both selfish and selfless (= having an irrational disregard for one&#8217;s self) behaviours should be avoided as much as possible, and that one should strive for &#8220;Rational Self-Growth&#8221; and that often &#8220;selfish vs. selfless&#8221; is presented as a false dichotomy.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="are_you_a_randroid">Does the fact that you were influenced by Objectivism (= Ayn Rand&#8217;s philosophy) make you a &#8220;Randroid&#8221;?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="are_you_a_randroid.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>The way I see it, a "Randroid" is an overzealous believer in Randianism, who mindlessly parrots Rand's works. On the other hand, my <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">philosophy, "Rindolfism"</a> is a crossover one with many influences, and dynamic. Moreover, I don't take Randianism as gospel, often deviate from it, and am critical of it. For example, I wrote a <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/">parody and modernisation of <i>The Fountainhead</i></a>, and also wrote <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/"><i>Summerschool at the NSA</i></a>, which I feel is a modernisation of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>.</p><p>If you still want to label me as a "Randroid", go ahead - I won't care that much. Just note that it is you who&#160;are being stupid, prejudiced and labelling.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="why_are_you_the_messiah">What makes you &#8220;The Messiah&#8221;?

Furthermore, I recommend thinking that you can "save the world" or at least change or improve it. Moreover, you can enjoy the world, and improve yourself and everyone else at the same time.</p><p>Note that there are still real command structures: your family, your superiors or bosses, your military commanders, your government, your customers and/or users (or your service providers), your friends, etc. If what they request you to do seems reasonable and beneficial, you should dedicate time to perform it <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/">in the best, "Rosh Gadol"-manner</a>.</p><p>That put aside, blindly following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">superior orders</a> is wrong, and you may wish to refuse an order, if it seems immoral or unethical.

HR drones who try to find faults in your online presence are going to be unhappy anyway, and from my impression they are usually wilfully stupid and thus quite evil and misguided.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="are_you_aware_that_the_jewish_bible_is_fictional">Are you aware that most of the stories in Jewish Bible are believed to be fictional, and there is no historical record that attests to them ever taking place?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="are_you_aware_that_the_jewish_bible_is_fictional.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>Yes, I'm fully aware of that, and I think it does not matter too much. <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#great-hackers">Quoting from an essay I wrote:</a></p><blockquote cite=""><p>A great hacker is an action hero that is aware enough of the essence of hacking to become a greater and greater hacker, despite whatever limitations he or she may have, and despite whatever setbacks they may run into.</p><p>Note that some great hackers <b>were clearly fictional</b> (e.g: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoda">Yoda</a>, <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/top-10-reasons-darth-vader-amazing-project-manager/">Darth Vader</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de-Winter</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Piggy">Miss Piggy</a>, or even <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Fluttershy">Fluttershy</a> ), some were female (e.g: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</a>) and some were underage (most notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shirley_Temple">Shirley Temple</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin">Macaulay Culkin</a> ).</p><p>So don't let anything stop you.</p><p/></blockquote><p>Just because a story or a saga are fictional, does not invalidate the fact that we can enjoy them, learn from them, use them for inspiration, and analyse them.</p><p>I don't take the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Bible</a> as gospel and still enjoy it. On the other hand, some <a href="./#atheism_can_be_a_religion">religious "atheists"</a> take it as "anti-gospel" which I find is philosophically immature too.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="atheism_can_be_a_religion">Why do you say that Atheism can be a religion? Atheism is the lack of religion!</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="atheism_can_be_a_religion.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>First of all, note that in <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1165982522091737088">this tweet</a>, I commented that <q>Following on <a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-www/2019/07/msg00153.html">a reply I wrote to a mailing list post</a>, I decided that I'll try avoiding the "X is a religion" argument. Many useful or insightful products/trends/movements have some zealots, including atheism, but they are still useful.</q>.</p><p>For the scope of this section I shall restrict the discussion of Atheists to those who believe or have a strong suspicion that God/the gods, however he/she/they/it are manifested do not exist. There may be other kinds of belief categories that fall under the umbrella of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atheism">atheism</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irreligion">irreligion</a>, but this subset of atheists does exist.</p><p>Anyway, from my experience, some Atheists can be overzealous and even very pushy about it, fanatical, or even have a cult of followers and <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sycophant">sycophants</a>. The original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazism">Nazis</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism">Communists</a> were ostensibly atheists but were destructive, and had their share of dogma, which other people and I find irrational. Note however that by the time of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a> many communist regimes were far more relaxed and rational in practice, and I suspect that following the popularity of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Colbert_Report">The Colbert Report</a>, most of the best "AltRight" neonazi bloggers are parody ones.</p><p>I do not wish to imply all fanatics, whether atheists or otherwise, were as destructive as them, just to note that believing or suspecting God does not exist, does not automatically make you free of faith or pseudo-faith.</p><p>Note that currently I am <a href="./#religious_belief">an agnostic</a>, and try not to be overzealous and pushy about it, but I do not rule out that there were or are or can be religious agnostics. Furthermore, I do not rule out that I may have my share of irrationalities, fanaticism or stubbornness in other realms of my life.</p><p>Just for the record, I recall reading on an Internet site, an excerpt from an interview with one of the creators of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park"><i>South Park</i></a> (which I admit I have not watched substantially) which was known for ridiculing various religions. That excerpt noted that they thought that despite all that, they found atheism the funniest religion, because the contemporary astronomical/astrophysical model excepts time to run out and end. This proved as one of the catalysts from my transition from a dogmatic atheist, to an <a href="./#religious_belief">open-minded and pluralistic agnostic</a>.</p></section></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
