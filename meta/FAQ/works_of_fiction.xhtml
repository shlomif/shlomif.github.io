Writing fan-fiction and crossovers, whether in fiction or in non-fiction (see some of my crossover essays) is the writing equivalent of what he describes being primarily done with music and videos.</p><p>Our aversion towards fan fiction and an insistence on "originality" is mostly a 20th century fad, that is slowly (for some values of "slowly") diminishing.</p><p>Anyway, the various fiction franchises and idea systems that influenced me are a large part of me, and I cannot throw them away when writing my own works.

According to the wikipedia page, such fiction is likely to be legal if it is done in mostly good taste, which I believe and hope is the case for me.</p><p>The general consensus is that a celebrity generally allows himself or herself to be a subject of reuse in literature, and that includes me, Shlomi Fish.</p><p><b>Update (2 November 2019):</b> I have now written a <a href="../../philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/">more comprehensive essay</a> about why writing real person fan fiction is good.</p><p><b>Update (26 November 2019):</b> I now realise that fan fiction and especially real person fiction can be used to help combat the flood of new characters and names that plagues many more "original" stories. People generally have a rough concept of what characters such as <a href="../../humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris</a>, <a href="../../humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/">Emma Watson</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Stallman">Richard Stallman</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses">Moses</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miss_Piggy">Miss Piggy</a>, are like and generally can better remember them because they thought about them a lot.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="featuring_sexy_women_and_girls">You feature sexy women and girls in your works. Are you a pervert?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="featuring_sexy_women_and_girls.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>Well, I don&#8217;t know about you, but I feel that a man who is attracted to women displaying competence, sexiness, strength, etc. - however interpreted - has a healthy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libido">libido (or &#8220;sex drive&#8221;)</a> rather than is a pervert, whose sexual preferences prevent him from functioning.</p><p>Anyway, do you really believe that when <a href="../../humour/bits/facts/Taylor-Swift/">Taylor Swift</a> depicted her friends and herself laying waste to a whole city in the videoclip for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Blood_(Taylor_Swift_song)">"Bad Blood"</a> (and <a href="../../humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Schwarzenegger">Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> and similar likely showed it more than once) that they actually are indeed so violent in real life? While sometimes I felt like going on a mayhem rage when there was a lot of commotion outside when I was trying to sleep or concentrate, I didn't actually do that, and at most only ranted about it online or called the police. I believe no <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#great-hackers">great action hero</a> will ever deliberately kick a friendly cat or dog.</p><p>Furthermore, just because I write about stuff like that, does not mean I do not have enough self-control, or that I have sex with, sexually assault, or sexually harass everything that moves.</p><p>Moreover, if you think my fiction is bad, you should try <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the Hebrew Bible</a> or, to a lesser extent, some of the modern <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slash_fiction">slash fiction</a> and other incest fiction that exist, and which: <b>1.</b> Many gay, lesbian, bisexual, and even trans people dislike; <b>2.</b> Its authors are often otherwise sexually healthy functioning adults.</p><hr/><p>Now regarding their <b>age</b>: yes, I'm aware that some of them are underage. However, it may seem farfetched, but I think that underage girls and boys can still be competent, both in their tangible endeavours, but also in their sexual/romantic orientation. Back at the time, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macaulay_Culkin">Macaulay Culkin</a>, who was the &#8220;alpha male&#8221; of a large part of the 1990s (despite his youth), raised a few eyebrows, when marrying at the age of 18 shortly after high school graduation. However, I recently heard of a Jewish couple of a husband and wife who were 15 then (with the girl pregnant), and as scary as it sounded, it didn&#8217;t seem too horrid of a thought. Some people <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lQALLGsn-Fk">learn faster than others</a>.</p><p>Just another note about Culkin: some people also criticised him for possessing Marijuana and for its use, but many young and not-so-young people I talked with have had a history of Marijuana use, or even Marijuana addiction, so I do not hold it against him. See my <a href="../../philosophy/politics/drug-legalisation/">&#8220;The Case for Drug Legalisation&#8221;</a> for why Marijuana, and all other illegal narcotics, should be made legal globally.</p><hr/><p>I also have <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1505075791943589890">a hypothesis</a> that pleasure, education (learning and teaching), and creativity / conception, are closely intertwined. Since we cannot expect children to avoid having fun, or to learn, we must accept the fact that they'll have sexual experiences.</p><hr/><p>Finally, note that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E._Nesbit">E Nesbit</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling">JK Rowling</a> both featured underage children in their books.</p><p>When PETA's twitter <a href="https://imgur.com/gallery/JuHnlSY+">criticised the sexualisation of catgirls in Anime</a>, it was criticised for not going against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street"><i>Sesame Street</i></a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic"><i>My Little Pony</i></a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Walt_Disney_Animation_Studios_films">Disney</a> and being bullies. (Note that PETA's Twitter may have improved in this aspect since.) So please pick on someone your size, or just admit you were wrong, and choose a more worthwhile battle.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="idolisation_of_people_and_things">Do you idolise the celebrities or fictional characters that you feature in your fan fiction?</h3><a class="indiv_node" href="idolisation_of_people_and_things.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>As a matter of fact, it may be considered this way. My fan fiction may be thought of as a modern age way of having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytheism">polytheistic</a> gods or otherwise <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacking-heroism">heroes</a>, that can be used for guidance and for shifting the blame from you, similar to the way that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plato">Plato</a> used dialogues with Socrates for that, or the Greek used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop">Aesop</a>.</p><p>Note that even if I idolise (or perhaps just <a href="../../humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=peikoff-what-is-is">idealise</a>) a person or a fictional character like that, it does not mean I actively worship them using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paganism">pagan</a> rituals. Nor do I believe they have supernatural superpowers, or see them as a supreme authority of telling me what to do. So I believe it does not go against the Jewish ethos. Moreover, the Jewish canon, sported some similar idols/"gods"/heroes besides <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah">"Jehovah"</a> / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">God</a> / the "King of the kings of the kings" / <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%A7%D7%93%D7%95%D7%A9_%D7%91%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%9A_%D7%94%D7%95%D7%90">haqadosh barukh hu</a> however they/he/she/it are manifested.

One should also note that there has been mutual influence on the factoids, and by them, with my longer <a href="../../humour/stories/">stories / screenplays</a>. Often such facts are being made up about celebrities or fictional characters on social media without being immediately recognised as such.</p><p>These "facts" are a natural evolution of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop">attributing fables to Aesop</a> (often ones thought about on the spot) or telling stories about <a href="./#idolisation_of_people_and_things">idols (whether real, fictional, human, immortal, etc.)</a>.</p><p>( I have similarly had <a href="../../humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/Queen-Padme-Tales--Queen-Amidala-vs-the-Klingon-Warriors.html#ethical--peaceful-resolution">Gowron attribute a quote to Kahless</a> which I came up with. )</p><p>Note that if you do not find these facts funny, that is OK - I still love you! &#128159; &#128521;!
