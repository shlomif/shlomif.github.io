First of all, I should note that it sounds like what I call a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conspiracy_theory">&#8220;conspiracy theory&#8221;</a> where one tries to formulate an <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ulterior_motive">ulterior motive</a> explanation instead of assuming purity of intents.</p><p>That put aside - what will driving traffic to my site, buy me exactly? I don't get paid for each visitor or "unique hit" or whatever, and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Wonderful">Project Wonderful</a> ads that used to be on my site were not pay-per-click, but rather pay-per-time (and now are no longer present after Project Wonderful announced that they will stop operating). While I admit I&#8217;d like my site to be as popular as possible, the real reason why I link to pages there is because they are relevant to the discussion at hand. If you&#8217;re too envious of me linking to my site, then please stop and get your own site which you can start populating with interesting content to your heart&#8217;s content.</p><section class="h4"><header><h4 id="advertise_your_site">Why do you advertise/&#8220;spam&#8221;/&#8220;self-promote&#8221; pages from your sites?</h4><a class="indiv_node" href="advertise_your_site.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>First of all note that it is <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1335187091895033856">"ableism"</a> as I tend to link to my sites/blogs/domain a lot due to a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomania</a> and slow typing due to hand paralysis. A lot of people think of blindness or deafness as the only disabilities, but there are many more, including <a href="../../philosophy/psychology/why-openly-bipolar-people-should-not-be-medicated/">bipolar disorder</a>, Schizophrenia, and even lacking or non-native knowledge of English and other languages. Some Haredi Jews locally block YouTube, due to a Jewish Law prohibition on hearing female vocalists.</p><p>I believe "anti-self-promotion" is a moral fashion popularised by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reddit">reddit</a> that was not present on <a href="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freecode">Freecode / Freshmeat</a>, (and still isn't) and which I'll do as much as I can to kill: <q>Chuck Norris was challenged to fight the world, and accepted. He bet on himself, won, and collected the bet money.</q>. Moreover, some subreddits do not enforce it either, and it makes even much less sense on interactive chats.</p><p>Also note that the pages on my sites usually do not require registration or login, whitelisting clientside JavaScript or <a href="./#link_here_to_drive_traffic">web ads</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1409316797069807616">This tweet by me reads:</a> <q>Dear Mr. Fear, go to hell! You have both crippled my body ( <a href="https://shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#which_disabilities_do_you_have">reference</a> ) and made anti-"self-promotion" a trend to stiffle my online forum presence. Well, I disbelieve all your lies and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/video/Seinfeld%20-%20The%20Opposite-SclV-UWM4Gw.mp4">am not afraid of being banned</a>.</q></p><p>Furthermore, like Ayn Rand in <a href="./#fav_fiction_books"><i>The Fountainhead</i></a> I believe in karma, and that being nasty and unkind to people can bite you further down the road (while being kind and generous returns seven folds). <a href="../../humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-perl-hurting-people">buu almost got himself killed</a> due to frequent online chat hostility and use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a> force (kicks, devoices, or bans). In addition, a former boss of mine who used to walk in the middle of the roads (hubris) in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gush_Dan">Gush Dan</a>, got badly injured in a car accident.</p></section></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
