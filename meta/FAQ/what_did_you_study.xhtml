That put aside, my studies involved quite a lot of software development and engineering-related mathematics. I also have not done a lot of EE or electronics work, before or after my degree studies, while doing quite a lot of software development.</p><p>Given how I recall my academic studies as being frustrating, vexing and often not interesting, I am not planning on working on getting another academic degree (whether a B.Sc, an M.A/M.Sc, a Ph.D or similar) soon. However, I cannot promise that I won't change my mind about that in the future and enrol again.</p><p>The funny thing is that while my mother and I are the only ones in our family without a doctorate, I am considered the smartest one. That may have to do with me being <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174648725316218880">more confident and "showy"</a> and more likely to flaunt or utilise my skills.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
