Which programming languages do you know now?</h3><a class="back_to_faq" href="./#programming_languages">Node Link</a></header><p>When I was in the 4th grade (back around 1987), my father bought my family a PC XT machine, with 640 KB of memory, and a colour <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_Graphics_Adapter">CGA</a> screen. Using this, my friends and I started learning how to program, first using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a> interpreter that was installed on the BIOS and was invoked if you didn&#8217;t put a diskette inside, and then using some of the BASIC variants that ran on DOS such as BASIC.COM, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW-BASIC">GWBASIC</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_BASICA">BASICA</a>. So for better or for worse, BASIC was my first language.</p><p>I&#8217;ve neglected programming for a long while and just played games on the computer, and possibly did some work on it. However, I returned to programming when I was in the 9th grade, this time on a 386 SX with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a> which came with some later versions of DOS, and later on with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_C%2B%2B">Borland Turbo C++</a> 3.0 (which sported a much more primitive variant of C++ compared to today&#8217;s flavours). Despite knowing C and C/C++, I still found QBasic of use, due to my ability to rapidly develop code in it (what Larry Wall later called &#8220;whipuptitude&#8221; in some of his talks.). I also may have dabbled with Excel&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications">Visual Basic for Applications (VBA)</a> before I graduated from high school, and during my 10th grade, I learned some Pascal using Microsoft QuickPascal on DOS.</p><p>After I graduated from high school, I worked at three firms. In some of them I've done C or C++ development on Windows, but I also studied some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL">SQL</a>, and became familiar with some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">UNIX</a> flavours and with <a href="http://perl-begin.org/">Perl 5</a> and the UNIX shells. UNIX has been an epiphany for me: until then I used DOS and Windows, and considered them bad, but did not know what a good system is. UNIX was the first genuinely good system that I have encountered. I also fell in love with Perl, and it became my favourite language.</p><p>By the time I started studying the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology">Technion</a>, I had a relatively early distribution of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> installed on my computer, and started playing with various languages available there.</p><p>You can find a list of languages that I currently know on <a href="../../SFresume.html">my r&#233;sum&#233;</a>.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
