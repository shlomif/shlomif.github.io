Otherwise, note that while I may be a competent software developer, I inhibit some issues that may make me unattractive to employers. See <a href="https://shlomif.livejournal.com/4408.html?mode=reply">my critique to a post</a> and <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160603203922/http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.197867.7">some replies I received</a>. I won't list my perceived problems here, just note that employers care about several aspects of an employee's suitability beside raw competency and knowledge, and often I feel they are right.</p><p>That put aside, if you are interested in hiring me, despite whatever limitations I may have, please contact me and we'll see about that.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
