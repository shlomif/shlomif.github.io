I was a big fan of UserFriendly.org when EvilPHish was featured there, and it was so me, so I decided to make it my emblem. After downloading the big version of the comic, and tampering with it a little with <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">GIMP (= the GNU Image Manipulation Program)</a>, I was able to produce a transparent PNG file that I could use.</p><p>After a while, I realised that most people recognised this emblem and associated it with me (in part because my last name is &#8220;Fish&#8221;) and decided to standardise on it as a user-pic or &#8220;avatar&#8221; everywhere, and so I did. Note that the image is still copyrighted by Mr. Iliad, but I hope its use by me is acceptable.</p><p>As a child and a teenager, I&#8217;ve been a bit frustrated by my last name being Fish, and was often teased for it. But I feel OK about it now, and it&#8217;s good that people can associate my last name with something they are familiar with, and with a memorable emblem such as EvilPHish.</p><p>You can also find <a href="../../me/images/EvilPHish-Icon/">various versions</a> of the EvilPHish image for download and reuse.</p><p><b>Update:</b> There is now a <a href="../../me/images/EvilPHish-Icon/svg/">vector graphics SVG version</a> courtesy of the amazing Marc Jeanmougin (Mc) and <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. It is placed under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">CC0</a> but may be a derivative work of the original by Iliad.</p><section class="h4"><header><h4 id="fish_alludes_to_christianity">Does the fish emblem allude to Christianity?</h4><a class="indiv_node" href="fish_alludes_to_christianity.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><p>No, it does not - it is just inspired by <a href="./#your_name">my last name</a>: &#8220;Fish&#8221;.
