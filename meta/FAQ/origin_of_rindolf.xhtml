I probably picked up the name by analogy with such Germanic-originating names as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randolph_%28given_name%29">Randolph</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolph_%28name%29">Rudolph</a>. I was told "Rind" means "cattle" in Germanic languages, but what matters is that it has a nice ring.</p><p>The first <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a> nickname I used was &#8220;dori&#8221; after one of the dwarves in Tolkien&#8217;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit">the Hobbit</a>. Later on, I decided it was a too common name, so I switched to &#8220;gloin&#8221;, the name of a different dwarf. Then I wanted something more original, so I picked up &#8220;rindolf&#8221; and the name stuck.</p><p>If I had been able to change it again, I would have picked &#8220;shlomif&#8221; for my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a> career, because it is my handle almost everywhere else, but now everyone on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a> know me as &#8220;rindolf&#8221; so I feel it's too late (not to mention that, in my impression, it is common and acceptable to use a pseudonym on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a>, to show some creativity).</p><p>The running joke we have on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a>, is that Rindolf is the evil twin brother of Santa Claus&#8217;s goody-two-shoes reindeer, Rudolph and Randolph, who are among his arch-enemies. Rindolf is also one of the cornerstones of the Evil Reindeer Evil World Domination Evil Conspiracy, with the evil aim to spread the Reindeer Evil all over the world. You can find some of the manifestations of this joke in <a href="../../humour/fortunes/">the IRC conversations quoted on my fortune cookies</a>.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
