Aside from high adventure, I now realise it contained a lot of criticism of the contemporary English society.</p><p>My favourite adult-oriented book is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead"><i>The Fountainhead</i></a> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a> which I bought and read once, and shortly afterwards my sister confiscated my copy because she too enjoyed reading it. Despite loving it, I found it necessary to <a href="../../humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/">parody and modernise it</a>, and it is likely that I had had, even back then and at least sub-consciously, a lot of contempt for the original work.</p><p>Do note that I threw away my only physical copy of <i>The Hobbit</i> (a cheap one that featured <a href="https://www.tednasmith.com/tolkien/rivendell/">this image of Rivendell</a>, and which we bought in London) due to my <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html">anti-"stuff" policy</a>.</p></section><section class="h4"><header><h4 id="tolkien_books">What do you think about the other books/films by Tolkien?</h4><a class="indiv_node" href="tolkien_books.xhtml">Node Link</a></header><ol><li><p>I read the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings"><i>The Lord of the Rings</i></a> in its Hebrew translation, and found it boring and not memorable. By some peer pressure, I tried reading it again in high school, and stopped in the middle of the first volume.</p><p>I strongly suspect that if it were written using <a href="./#why_real_person_fiction">fan fiction</a> characters (e.g: Sauron &#8594; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashurbanipal">Ashurbanipal</a> ; Gandalf &#8594; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses">Moses</a> ; Frodo &#8594; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David">David</a> ), it would be better in many ways: more memorable, shorter, funnier, more fun, and with a more effective message.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Silmarillion"><i>The Silmarillion</i></a> - was OK but I do not remember most of the plot (and do not care enough to).</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farmer_Giles_of_Ham">Farmer Giles of Ham</a> was incredibly funny, succinct, and memorable. I may gladly read it again sometimes.</p></li><li><p>The film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring"><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i></a> could have been more enjoyable if the cinema my father and I watched it on would have provided an intermission, because by the end of its 3 hours we really had to pee. (Re <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quote/23596.html">Alfred Hitchcock's quote</a>.)</p><p>My father and other family (but not I) have watched the other two films on DVD at home, which was easily capable of being paused and sought.

It was boring and I'd have stopped much earlier if I didn't want to prepare for the next year's literature classes.</p><p>For the record, I read and completed some long books in both Hebrew and English which I found more interesting and captivating, and which I wasn't forced to read for class.

On one hand, this is the kind of book that every modern intellectual is expected to read. On the other hand, its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">Signal to noise ratio</a> is extremely low and it is not compliant with <a href="https://www.robcottingham.ca/cartoon/archive/tldr/">TL;DR</a> / TL;DW / TL;DL.
