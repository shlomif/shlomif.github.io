It had the address http://www.smlink.com/~shlomif/, now inactive, where shlomif was my username on ibm.net back then (which ended up becoming my general unofficial ID). We hosted the server behind our Point-to-Point connection (not such a smart idea retrospectively) and we had to create the alias in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Information_Services">IIS</a> specifically for me to put stuff there.</p><p>I recall that I had <a href="../../humour.html">the Aphorisms collection</a> with a few jokes I originated, as well as <a href="../../toggle.html">the report about the algorithmic solution to the Toggle Squares puzzle</a> I sent to its originator (with whom I was corresponding at the time). And it also had a rudimentary pageful of links, and a bio.</p><p>When I became a student in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology">Technion</a>, I moved my site to its undergraduate server at the address http://t2.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/ . There I added more and more resources to the site. Here is the site <a href="../../meta/old-site-snapshots/">as of 1998</a>. I had a limited quota there, and when I got an account on &#8220;vipe&#8221;, a server managed by the students, I hosted part of my home site there as well, as http://vipe.technion.ac.il/~shlomif/ . The two parts of the site had cross-links to one another.</p><p>Eventually, I was about to graduate and so moved the t2.technion.ac.il part of my homesite, first to shlomif.il.eu.org (a free hostname, which ended up causing too many DNS problems), and then to www.shlomifish.org which is where it has been residing until now. In the process, I converted all of the main pages to use <a href="http://thewml.org/">Website Meta Language</a> and what would eventually become <a href="http://web-cpan.shlomifish.org/latemp/">Latemp</a>. This has enabled the site to have a common look and feel, a nice CSS stylesheet, a navigation menu and other navigation aids and other nice features.</p><p>Eventually I realised that the vipe server has too much down time (due to problems at the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology">Technion</a>&#8217;s network) and moved all of its content over to the www.shlomifish.org domain.</p><p>Throughout all this time, many resources were added to the homesite: software, essays, stories, artwork, presentations, puzzles, and more information about myself. I also now maintain a large number of <a href="../../me/blogs/">blogs</a> and sites for my projects, as well as sites I volunteered to maintain. I really like the way the web allows me to express myself, and to communicate using text, hypertext, and other types of media.</p><p>Even more recently, I've been writing more and more on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_media">social media</a> outlets. There&#8217;s <a href="./#shlomif_on_the_web">a list</a> of my accounts for many social media and user-generated-content sites on every page of my home site.</p><p>In case you&#8217;re interested in setting up a personal web site of your own, I wrote <a href="../../philosophy/computers/web/create-a-great-personal-homesite/">an article about it</a>, which you can read.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
