Also note that despite the fact that I am Jewish by ethnicity, and heritage, and studied (or was forced to study, although I often enjoyed it) some of the Jewish writings, and incorporated influences from it in my writing, I am not a religious or observant Jew.</p><p>All that put aside, I consider myself a self-sufficient, optimistic, idealistic and anti-cynical, pluralistic, anti-Fatalist, agnostic. Now let me explain what all those mean:</p><ul><li><p>I&#8217;m <b>agnostic</b> because I&#8217;m not sure whether God &#8212; however he/she/they/it are manifested &#8212; exists or not. I suspect they do, but don&#8217;t take chances and <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/tie_your_camel.xhtml">don&#8217;t wish to risk dying</a> - now or ever.</p></li><li><p>I&#8217;m <b>self-sufficient</b> because I believe that &#8220;The gods help those that help themselves&#8221;, that &#8220;reality to be conquered must be obeyed&#8221; and all that Jazz.</p></li><li><p>I am optimistic, idealistic and <b>anti-cynical</b> because I believe that people are inherently good, can be trusted and that humanity is going forward instead of backward. I feel like my life is gradually improving and that almost every day is the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW3rK-giAaM">best day of my life</a> so far, and that 2014 (when these lines were written) is the best year I can remember (and I&#8217;m 1977-born).</p></li><li><p>I&#8217;m <b>pluralistic</b>, because I constantly have derived and will derive inspiration from <a href="../../me/rindolf/#rindolfism">many sources</a> and also try to not dismiss an insight based on its source - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">Ad-hominem</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_Hitlerum">Reductio ad Hitlerum</a> for more information about why this is fallacious.</p><p>Also see <a href="../../humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=larry-wall-all-truth-is-gods-truh">this quote by Larry Wall</a> about <q>All Truth is God's Truth</q>.</p></li><li><p>I am <b>anti-Fatalistic</b> because I believe that humans&#8217; survival mechanism - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reason">reason</a> - operates <a href="../../philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/dont_just_go_with_the_flow.xhtml"><b>by choice</b></a>, and not automatically, and that we have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will">free will</a>. This is as opposed to the new age crop of neo-Deterministic materialistic atheists who believe that the laws of physics dictate exactly what a person will think and do.</p><p><b>Note:</b> I was told that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatalism">Fatalism</a> vs. free will is a much older debate than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a> (reason operates by choice) or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Harris">Sam Harris</a> (who reportedly used to advocate Fatalism).</p></li></ul></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
