It was boring and I'd have stopped much earlier if I didn't want to prepare for the next year's literature classes.</p><p>For the record, I read and completed some long books in both Hebrew and English which I found more interesting and captivating, and which I wasn't forced to read for class. I also struggled less with some other assigned texts (e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis">Kafka&#8217;s <i>The Metamorphosis</i></a>).</p></li><li><p>That put aside - analysing it in class, after the summer vacation, was fun.</p></li><li><p>In retrospect, I could tell that Raskolnikov is described as having <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinical depression</a>.</p></li><li><p>At least one friend of mine did enjoy reading it, and found it captivating.</p></li><li><p>On a different page, I <a href="../../philosophy/the-eternal-jew/#reception">compare <abbr title="Crime and Punishment">C&amp;P</abbr> to Little Red Riding Hood</a> and conclude that the latter was far more influential, successful, and better written. (Even though I have some reservations about its message.)</p></li><li><p>I'm not going to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment"><abbr title="Crime and Punishment">C&amp;P</abbr></a> again willingly, unless someone pays me a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJrqpR_7VSo">shitload of money</a>.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_pi4mbqQ6E">Zehu Zeh's reflection on Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment"</a> - (from the Israeli Educational Television; in Hebrew) was incredibly funny and true.</p></li></ol><p>So: should you read it? On one hand, this is the kind of book that every modern intellectual is expected to read. On the other hand, its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal-to-noise_ratio">Signal to noise ratio</a> is extremely low and it is not compliant with <a href="https://www.robcottingham.ca/cartoon/archive/tldr/">TL;DR</a> / TL;DW / TL;DL. It is possible that reading the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_and_Punishment">wikipedia page</a> or a different summary will be adequate (assuming you are not forced to read it in class).</p><p>And take my advice at your own risk. If it breaks, you get to keep both pieces. &#128521;</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
