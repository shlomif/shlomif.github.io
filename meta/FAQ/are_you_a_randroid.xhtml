On the other hand, my <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/rindolf/#rindolfism">philosophy, "Rindolfism"</a> is a crossover one with many influences, and dynamic. Moreover, I don't take Randianism as gospel, often deviate from it, and am critical of it. For example, I wrote a <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/">parody and modernisation of <i>The Fountainhead</i></a>, and also wrote <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/"><i>Summerschool at the NSA</i></a>, which I feel is a modernisation of <i>Atlas Shrugged</i>.</p><p>If you still want to label me as a "Randroid", go ahead - I won't care that much. Just note that it is you who&#160;are being stupid, prejudiced and labelling.</p></section></main><footer><div class="foot_left"><ul class="bt_nav"><li><a href="../../">Home</a></li><li><a href="../../me/">About</a></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/">Contact Us</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/privacy-policy/">Privacy Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/anti-spam-policy/">Anti-Spam Policy</a></li><li><a href="../../meta/FAQ/" title="Frequently asked questions list">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="../../me/blogs/">RSS/Atom Feeds</a></li></ul><p>Written, designed, and maintained by Shlomi Fish, <a href="mailto:shlomif@shlomifish.org">shlomif@shlomifish.org</a>.</p></div><a href="../../"><img src="../../images/bk2hp-v2.min.svg" class="bk2hp" alt="Back to my Homepage"/></a></footer></body></html>
