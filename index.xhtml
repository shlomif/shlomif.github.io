The Commercial Fanfiction Initiative - May 2021</h3><p><b>The Commercial Fanfiction Initiative</b></p><p>The biggest news is the <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/" target="_blank">commercial fanfiction initiative</a>, which aims to make the film industry flourish just like open music on youtube/etc. or FOSS in the software world. The scope is somewhat larger, covering accepting screenplays in easier-to-write formats, and being communicative about why a screenplay was rejected.</p><p>Some people online told me "commercial fanfiction will never happen" and two fellow writers of (gratis, Internet-hosted) fanfiction said it will be "unethical" to try to profit off other writers' hard work. However, I recall people expressing similar sentiments about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">open source software</a> and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/" target="_blank">early music file swapping / file sharing / "piracy"</a> and Wikipedia… I often grow older and more foolish, and some people do support the cause.</p><p>I also wouldn't call the current situation with many beautiful, competent, and either famous or budding actors and actresses unemployable, a lack of screenplay submissions, franchise fatigue, and film makers and executives increasingly feeling depressed and trapped and general watchers dissatisfaction "ethical". The enemies of commercial fanfic are recent bylaws, and court precedents. <b>Guidelines!</b></p><p>And I have a plan forward, which isn't set in stone, and may require improvisation, and may fail.

That put aside, feel free to submit pull-requests, patches, or CSS fragments if you think they will improve matters.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>I am offering to <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/relicensing-my-entire-portfolio-under-cc-by/">relicense</a> all the cultural works I created and placed on my site under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-by</a> if I get 10 million Euro.</p></li><li><p>There is a new essay titled <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/">Putting Cards on the Table (2019-2020)</a> which aims to provide a snapshot of Rindolfism, my personal philosophy:</p><blockquote><p>The Israeli military was small and as there was a lot of work to do to properly secure the Israeli civilians it coined the terms <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/">Rosh gadol ("big minded") and Rosh qatan ("small minded")</a> to encourage the soldiers to take initiative and try to perform their jobs as well as possible, regardless of the fact they were paid little.</p><p>This extends to non-military work, government work, and voluntary work or hobbies and endeavours: if you care about something, do it as well as possible and give it enough time as needed. It will get easier and faster in time.</p><p>For instance, a vendor on a candy store or an icecream parlour, should try to greet the customers, be friendly to them, offer recommendations to them if they ask, accept business cards with their personal web sites or social media presence and visit them, and generally treat every customer like royalty.</p><p>If you do this, you'll likely get more returning customers, bigger tips, bigger bonuses and raises, and you may be able to land a better job based on a warm recommendation from your superiors and coworkers.</p><p>The opposite is just following orders blindly, "I just work here" attitude, which is no different from the Nazis' <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">Superior orders - "I was only following orders"</a> which leads to laziness, stagnation, vandalism and sadism, just like the German Nazis in World War II, or the Knights Templar in Saladin's time.</p></blockquote></li><li><p>There is a new collection of <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Taylor-Swift/">factoids about Taylor Swift</a> as well as new <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris factoids</a> and new <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/">Emma Watson factoids</a>:</p><ul><li><blockquote><p>If Apple ever tried to sue Taylor Swift for trademark violations of Apple Swift, they will spend all their money on litigation, and still lose. This will make many lawyers richer, and the world a better place.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Chuck Norris’s roundhouse kicks are licensed under the public domain because no one besides him can duplicate them.</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>Emma Watson played Hermione in the Harry Potter films, but she doesn’t need a wand to kick your ass.</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li><p><a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/">"Why I will continue to write my real person fan fiction (fanfic)"</a> is an essay about why real person fiction appears to hurt Hollywood actors and why it cannot hurt singers or YouTubers.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/why-openly-bipolar-people-should-not-be-medicated/">"Why Openly Bipolar People Should Not Be Medicated"</a> is a new essay.</p></li><li><p>The site's pages have been converted from <a href="https://github.com/thewml/website-meta-language">Website Meta Language</a> which is slow and errorprone to <a href="http://template-toolkit.org/">Template Toolkit</a> which is faster and more predictable.</p></li></ol><p>Hope you enjoy all that!</p><p><a href="https://shlomif-hsite.livejournal.com/20556.html">See comments and comment on this.</a></p></article><article><h3 class="newsitem" id="shlomifish.org_news_2019_04_18">18-Apr-2019: Conversion to (X)HTML5, Mobile-friendlier style, cleanups and new content</h3><p>Here are the recent updates for <a href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">Shlomi Fish’s Homepage</a>.</p><ol><li><p>Most of the site's pages have been converted to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML#XHTML5">XHTML5</a>, which is the newest standard.</p></li><li><p>The site's style has been made more mobile-friendly (so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design">responsive web design</a>).
