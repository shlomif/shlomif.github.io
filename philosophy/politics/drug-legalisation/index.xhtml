They believe that just because the drugs are physically harmful, they should be banned. Yet, this is very far from the fact. While drugs can be harmful, there is no good reason to make them illegal. In fact, the prohibition on drugs causes so many undesirable side-effects, that they <span class="bold"><strong>must</strong></span> be made legal.</p><p>If this sounds fantastic to you - read on, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll find out that I know what I&#8217;m saying.</p><p>The war on drugs has been supported by both the left and right political camps, and has only been rejected by Libertarians and various other minority groups who hold this view. As a result, most people who believe they should choose between left, right or middle, think drug prohibition is acceptable on everybody. But this is not the case. The prohibition on drugs is very harmful to the public and individual well-being and must be eradicated as soon as possible.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="morality" class="title">The Morality of Drug Abuse</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/morality.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>A person has a basic right to harm himself, as long as he does not harm others in the process. That&#8217;s because everyone of us is the owner of his mind, body and property, and is solely responsible for their use and abuse.</p><p>All arguments that do not favour that, like that a person thus contributes less to society, and becomes a burden on it are pretty silly. That&#8217;s because a person is never obliged to contribute to society (&#8220;First, do not harm&#8221;), and the society at large is not obliged to support its members. (It would be Socialistic to claim otherwise.)</p><p>Thus, a person must be allowed by law to consume drugs. I&#8217;m not saying it is desirable if a person exercises this right. I&#8217;m just saying that a person should be allowed to do so, just as he is allowed to smoke, drink alcoholic beverages, deteriorate in personal hygiene, give away money for no good reason, act stupidly, etc. These are all harmful activities, yet perfectly legitimate.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="biology" class="title">The Biology of Drug Use</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/biology.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>Drugs are not as harmful as many people think. Most drug users are perfectly healthy people who just happen to have a drug problem, just like people who smoke, or are alcoholics, or are addicted to caffeine have a drug problem. Otherwise, they are able to function properly and be good citizens. There are no recorded deaths from Marijuana in the U.S. The amount of deaths for Cocaine is 20 per 100,000 (4 if we take into account such factors as its reduced quality), and the deaths from Heroin are 400 per 100,000 (or 80 if we take these factors into account). This is compared to 150 deaths per 100,000 from Alcohol and 650 from Tobacco. Taking the numbers into account, in the U.S. there used to be 390,000 deaths per year from Tobacco, 150,000 from Alcohol and only 400 from Heroin and 200 from Cocaine (and none from Marijuana). (<a class="link" href="http://www.cato.org/pubs/pas/pa121.html">Source</a>.)</p><p>Thus, legalising drugs, which would potentially make them more common, will not be a hazard to the global health status of the population.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="bio_psychology" class="title">The Bio-Psychology of Drug Use</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/bio_psychology.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>The mere act of consuming illegal narcotics, usually does not cause one to commits crimes. While drugs affect the mind, a large increase in drug consumption by itself will not cause a large increase in the number of crimes committed.</p><p>Note that criminal activity is often related to drug use due to its present illegal nature and the fact drug users steal in order to acquire drugs.

Much more inflated that the amount it requires to grow, manufacture and distribute them. As a result, there is a growing black market for the distribution of drugs and drug users eventually need to commit crimes like theft and robbery to support their habits.</p><p>The average crime rate in the U.S increased twice fold due to the prohibition on Alcohol. Once the prohibition was lifted, it decreased back to its original state. It is expected that drug-induced crimes cause a similar increase, due to the similar nature of this prohibition.</p><p>In this analysis one should also include the very &#8220;crimes&#8221; of drug use, trafficking, and sale, as well as crimes caused due to the criminal nature of some drug dealers. Drug trafficking is also a huge source of income for Organised crime.</p><p>All of this crime can be eliminated in a swift blow by legalising drugs. When drugs will become legal, they will be produced, distributed and sold by local legitimate entities, who will be subject to Capitalistic market constraints. Their prices will drop to a minimum, allowing everybody to buy them at the needed quantities.

You go to the store and sometimes there are harmful chemicals in the liquor, sometimes the prices are extremely high, sometimes there is no liquor at the store at all. Only once in a blue moon are prices very good and quality good (say, it only happens once a year). In that case, you would buy as much as you could afford. Naturally, people who only use alcohol might not agree with this, but that's because they have never been in that situation, since alcoholic beverages are fully legal.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="arguments_for__causes_proliferation" class="title">The Prohibition on Drugs Causes Proliferation of Drugs&#8217; Use</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/arguments_for__causes_proliferation.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>People who become heavy drug users often need to find a way to finance their habit.

And a great way to push drugs on people is to consume drugs with them. So, to make more money, they end up consuming more drugs.</p><p>Making drugs legal will stop this vicious cycle.

Making drugs legal will kill this easy way out, and force the young people of the poor to struggle for a honest living and gradually advance their personal and collective financial status.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="arguments_for__unholy_enemy" class="title">Drug Users Serve as the &#8220;Unholy Enemy&#8221; of Society</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/arguments_for__unholy_enemy.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>There is a common pattern in history of &#8220;unholy enemies&#8221; - groups of people who are presented by leaders to be of such evil nature that the general populace should be willing to sacrifice their lives, freedom or well-being to fight them. These have been the Jews in Nazi Germany, and the Kafirs in Islam.

Therefore, drug users are always around other drug users, and likely always around drugs, and therefore tend to do them more. When breaking a habit, you must stop your enablers, but drug users eventually mostly have other drug users as friends, so it is very hard to break the habit of drug use even after it becomes a problem. &#8206;That is because they are always around drugs and other users and it takes a large amount of will power to refuse taking drugs when one is around it all the time.</p><p>As a result, drug users form a <span class="bold"><strong>subculture</strong></span>. The drug user ends up alienated from his or her non-drug using friends. However, the cause is not the drug or the drug problem, it is the illegal stance society takes on drugs. One is a criminal if they possess drugs, so they will not do this openly, yet they can do this somewhat openly among the drug-using subculture, and possessing drugs in that subculture makes you high status in that subculture. Drugs and especially good quality drugs are of a higher value in that subculture, than being rich.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="arguments_for__legit_uses" class="title">Prevention of Legitimate Uses</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/arguments_for__legit_uses.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>The prohibition of illegal drugs prevents some legitimate uses of the plants from which they are made.

The first is that they are simply clueless or misled enough to believe that the prohibition is a good thing. Many ordinary and perfectly honest people have also bought the pro-prohibition advocacy and voice opinions supporting it.</p><p>The other explanation is that some of these people know better and are acting <a class="link" href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/42320.html">in an evil, destructive, and dishonest manner</a>.
