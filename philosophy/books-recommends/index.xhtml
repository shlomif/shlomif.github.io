This book is the definitive guide to refactoring, at least in object-oriented systems.</p><p>The first chapters of the book are rather general. They introduce the motivation for refactoring, why it is good, and why it actually speeds up development. Also, they also give a list of “bad smells” in the code that indicate that a refactoring is needed (like duplicate code or magic numbers). I found the bad smells part to be the most illuminating part of the book.</p><p>The middle part of the book which is its lion’s share is a catalogue of various refactorings. These are things like extracting a method, creating a superclass, eliminating inheritance, or creating one. The author explains there each refactoring, when to do it, the steps for performing it most safely, and then usually gives an example of how to do it. I found the catalogue a bit tedious to read, but interesting nonetheless. It taught me some new techniques that I was not previously aware of.</p><p>The final chapters wrap up the book, and are also interesting to read. They consist of an essay by William Opdyke (who wrote a very early research paper on refactoring) titled “Refactoring, Reuse and Reality”, a chapter about <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/tools.html">Refactoring Tools</a>, and a short summarising chapter by Kent Beck.</p><p>The book smells a bit of hype: Java is used as the example language (albeit its use there is quite justified); there are many UML diagrams (which were at first confusing to me due to the many kind of arrows they have); and there are references of several of the so-called Design Patterns. (from the Gang of Four book and otherwise). But they don’t detract much from an otherwise good book.</p><p>The book can also be used as a reference to look for refactorings or see how can they be performed well. I think this book has made me more conscious of how I refactor and write code, and I try to refactor in a way that will minimize the errors caused by it. I’m also now more aware of the “two hats”, as Fowler puts it, of either refactoring code or adding new features.</p><p>To sum, this is a very good and important book to read, especially for beginning programmers. I’m just not sure it justifies the $54.00 list price. This price is too high for a book of this scope.</p></div></div><div class="prod" id="art_of_unix_programming"><div class="head"><p class="prod_img"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131429019/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/"><img alt="Preview" src="images/art_of_unix_programming.jpg"/></a></p><p class="prod_title"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0131429019/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/">The Art of UNIX Programming</a><br/>Eric S.

It is divided into three sections:</p><ul><li><p>In the first: a sample financial TDD project is developed in Java, with instructions on how to proceed every way. The standard “add-failing-test; get it to pass; refactor;” cycle is described there with a TODO list as a tool. This was the best section, in my opinion.</p></li><li><p>In the second section, Beck bootstraps an xUnit framework in Python starting from nothing (and compares it to doing brain surgery on yourself.).</p></li><li><p>In the third section, he briefly discusses various TDD patterns. I admit I did not pay enough attention there because I read the book before going to sleep when I was tired, and want to go over it again.</p></li></ul><p>So I can recommend this book for all people who want to learn how to do TDD better. Mr. Beck kinda aims for the high ideal of TDD and I often deviate from it, which I think is OK.</p></div></div><div class="prod" id="programming_pearls"><div class="head"><p class="prod_img"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201657880/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/"><img alt="Preview" src="images/programming_pearls.jpg"/></a></p><p class="prod_title"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201657880/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/">Programming Pearls</a><br/>Jon Bentley</p></div><div class="desc"><p>I've heard this book mentioned in several places before buying it and reading it and it did not disappoint me. This book is really great, with interesting coverage of interesting programming and computer science-related topics. It has an extensive discussion of optimising code, which I appreciated, being very interested in it (see: <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Optimizing_Code_for_Speed">my essay about it</a> ), and lots of other interesting stuff. The second edition was updated for modern times, and feels quite fresh.</p><p>Bentley mentions in the book that he has written a book called "Writing Efficient Programs" which is now out-of-print with some techniques for optimising code. I was saddened to hear that it is indeed out-of-print, because I would like to read it. He does give a summary of the book in an appendix, though.</p><p>The book contains many exercises, most of which I’ve mentally thought about, but did not actually solve using the computer. Otherwise, I enjoyed reading this book and can wholeheartedly recommend it.</p></div></div><div class="prod" id="more_programming_pearls"><div class="head"><p class="prod_img"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201118890/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/"><img alt="Preview" src="images/more_programming_pearls.jpg"/></a></p><p class="prod_title"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201118890/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/">More Programming Pearls: Confessions of a Coder</a><br/>Jon Bentley</p></div><div class="desc"><p>A fellow Perl programmer bought me this book as a birthday present from my Amazon.com wishlist because I put it there out of wishing to read the follow-up to the previous book in the series which I enjoyed. However, this book failed to meet my expectations, and I found it disappointing.</p><p>It does not have the same focus on topics that interest me and instead contains many different topics. While not being completely bad, it fails to live up to the promise of the previous book, and I cannot really recommend it. The book is also showing its age.</p><p>The book page on Amazon.com used to contain a single 3-star review for <i>More Programming Pearls</i> which kinda summarises my feelings.</p></div></div><div class="prod" id="algorithm_design_manual"><div class="head"><p class="prod_img"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1848000693/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/"><img alt="Preview" src="images/algorithm_design_manual.jpg"/></a></p><p class="prod_title"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1848000693/ref=nosim/shlomifishhom-20/">The Algorithm Design Manual</a><br/>Steven S. Skiena</p></div><div class="desc"><p>I received this book as an Amazon.com gift, after I placed it on my wishlist by inspiration from that of someone else. For some reason, it was sent to an old address of ours, which caused some confusion because I did not recall ordering it. But eventually I realised what happened.</p><p>Based on the cover of the book, and its title, I got a somewhat different idea of what it would be about than what it really was, and thought it would be very technical and formal. However, this preconception was dis-spelled shortly after I started reading it. In fact, the book is quite offbeat, without too many rigorous proofs.</p><p>The book is split into two parts. In the first one, we are given an overview of the theory behind algorithms with a lot of sample code in C, and with some "take home lessons", detailed "war stories", where the author explains how he implemented the topics covered in his work as a professor and algorithm designer, some exercises, and an accessible coverage of the subject. Some topics I liked there was the coverage of simulated annealing, his explanation of why he found genetic algorithms lacking, and the coverage of back tracking, all of which were missing from my formal computer science education.</p><p>The second part of the book was nicknamed "The Hitchhiker's Guide to Algorithms" and provides an overview of the various algorithms and their implementations available for the various algorithmic objectives. While also good and enlightening, my only qualm is that it took me a long time to read, and by that time, felt the first part of the book was a distant memory.</p><p>Still, this is a good book with good coverage of the subject of Algorithmics. I can recommend it.</p></div></div></div></div></div><script>shlomif_load_nav("philosophy/books-recommends/");</script><p class="share"><a href="http://www.addtoany.com/share_save?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shlomifish.org%2Fphilosophy%2Fbooks-recommends%2F&amp;linkname="><img src="../../images/share_save_171_16.png" width="171" height="16" class="bless" alt="Share/Bookmark"/></a><br/></p></main><nav class="navbar" id="navbar"><div class="center"><a href="../../" title="Shlomi Fish’s Homepage"><img src="../../images/evilphish-svg.min.svg" alt="EvilPHish by Illiad" class="highlight" style="border:0;margin-bottom:.5em"/></a></div><ul class="nav_links"><li><a href="../" title="Previous Page (Alt+P)" accesskey="p"><img src="../../images/arrow-2-left.png" alt="Previous Page" class="bless"/></a></li><li><a href="../" title="Up in the Site (Alt+U)" accesskey="u"><img src="../../images/arrow-2-up.png" alt="Up in the Site" class="bless"/></a></li><li><a href="../philosophy/" title="Next Page (Alt+N)" accesskey="n"><img src="../../images/arrow-2-right.png" alt="Next Page" class="bless"/></a></li></ul><div id="nav_menu"><ul><li><a href="../../">Shlomi Fish’s Homepage</a></li><li class="open"><a href="../../me/">About Myself</a><br/><ul><li><a href="../../personal.html" title="A Short Biography of Myself">Bio</a><br/><ul><li><a href="../../me/intros/" title="Introductions of Me to Various Forums">Intros</a><br/><ul><li><a href="../../me/intros/writers/" title="My Intro to the MIT Writers Mailing List">MIT Writers</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="../../me/contact-me/" title="How to Contact Me">Contact Me</a></li><li><a href="../../me/rindolf/" title="The history and etymology of “Rindolf”, Shlomi Fish’s Nickname">“Rindolf” -
