<!DOCTYPE html><section class="h2"><header><h2 id="hollywood_screenplay_format">Ditching Hollywood's Screenplay Format</h2><a class="back_to_faq" href="../#hollywood_screenplay_format">Node Link</a></header><p>Hollywood's blessed screenplay format is boring, finicky, and requires a lot of time to prepare and get right. It only has one proprietary Windows-only program and one unmaintained, slow, and non-responsive, open source program - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celtx">Celtx</a>, that can be used to edit it.</p><p>Moreover, it is poorly documented, cannot be <a href="https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters">validated and linted</a> by an automated program, and <a href="https://alistapart.com/article/unwebbable/">has issues being XML and HTML-friendly</a></p><p>As a hacker/action hero I'd rather <a href="../../../../humour/stories/">my screenplays</a> never be filmed by Hollywood studios, than waste time preparing one in its blessed format. Furthermore, since it cannot be automatically <a href="https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters">linted or validated</a>, one often needs to revise or amend the drafts, which is even more time-consuming. Rinse and repeat.</p><p>One can imagine most young or young-at-heart screen writers who use code sharing sites and services (e.g:&#160;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> or GitLab), wikis, desktop or online word processors, etc. will also sport the same sentiments.</p><p id="hacker-laziness">As <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/popular.html">Paul Graham</a> notes in a different context: <q>Hackers are lazy, in the same way that mathematicians and modernist architects are lazy: they hate anything extraneous.</q></p><p>So a lack of "original" screenplays and many unemployed screenplay readers is not surprising.</p><p>Note that even if a screenwriter has prepared such Hollywood-blessed screenplays in the past, he or she likely met enough fans, critics (either positive or <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">negative</a> or mixed), collaborators, etc. (see <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/The-Earth-Angel/The-Earth-Angel--English-Text.html">the "Earth Angel" concept</a> or the <a href="https://explainxkcd.com/519/">subtext of xkcd: "11th grade"</a>) that they will adopt a similar mindset. Even though I am 1977-born (so approaching 44 in 2021) there are some time consuming things I have done in the past which I will not repeat such as <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/#technion_vs_projeuler">studying Electrical Engineering in the Technion</a>, or working for distrustful or <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#big-minded-vs-small-minded">micromanaging</a> bosses (though as the contemporary and more competent me, I may now try to reform them using <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#benevolent-psychological-warfare">benevolent psychological warfare</a> ).</p><p>This is while I can spend hundreds of hours contributing text, code, and markup, voluntarily and without expecting immediate payment, to the public. And this includes my pro-bono contributions to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_(operating_system)">Fedora Linux</a>, which is backed and led by a profitable and well financed for-profit company (= <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Hat">Red Hat, Inc.</a>).</p><hr><p>I thought I invented illustrated screenplays, "by need", but recently saw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_pen_is_mightier_than_the_sword&amp;oldid=998361214">illustration on Edward Bulwer-Lytton's stage play "Richelieu"</a> after I searched the web for his "The pen is mightier than the sword" adage.</p><p>Furthermore, a fellow writer, who was less techsavvy than I was at the time (and wished to remain ignorant of software development) told me that "[hyper-]linking is not writing". However, not only did the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> had hyperlinks of sorts (references to other works), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-canonical_books_referenced_in_the_Bible">many are currently broken</a>.</p><p>Also note that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qere_and_Ketiv">known spelling mistakes</a> in the canonical text of the Hebrew Bible, so it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection#Paradoxes">imperfect</a>.</p><hr><p>So I suggest Hollywood studios to also accept screenplays either in a subset of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML#XHTML5">XHTML5</a> (which will be capable of being validated using <a href="https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters">an open source, easy to install, and portable linter</a>) , or an XML-based format, either a subset of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_Encoding_Initiative">TEI</a> or a custom format. Perhaps any self-contained XHTML5/HTML5 page or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB">EPUB</a> can be accepted, including ones on the public-facing web.</p><p>One can find many screenplays like that in <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/"><b>Archive of our own</b></a>, but there are likely many more.</p><p>Given many screenplays are reworked, or even improvised upon during filming, their formatting should not be too draconian and finicky, anyway.</p><p>I am quite happy with my <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">XML-Grammar-Fiction</a>'s custom "Screenplay-Text" format, as well as its "Screenplay-XML" XML grammar, and I added more features to these grammars as I needed them ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it">YAGNI - "You aren't going to need it"</a> ). Nevertheless, I'd be happy with other grammars that can be validated and linted.</p><p>It is also conceivable to write converters from subsets of other trendy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">lightweight markup languages</a> (e.g : <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#CommonMark">CommonMark</a> ) other document formats such as Google Docs or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument</a>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> capable hacker and geeky screenwriters will also increasingly <a href="../#originality_is_self_defeating">write crossovers, parodies and RPFs</a> from similar reasons. See <a href="../#originality_is_self_defeating">this</a> for more info.</p><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="be_communicative">Be communicative</h3></header><blockquote cite="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/" class="fancy"><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> And so did my good Greek friend, Alexander, who started by writing some poems to her which I didn&#8217;t like, and told him why. So he ended up improving slowly but surely, until he wrote a truly great poem about her, and people loved it.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Then Phoebe &#8212; that&#8217;s her name &#8212; told him, while crying, that she loved the song, but that she still is not going to marry him.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Alexis:</strong> The Bitch!</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> My thoughts exactly. Anyway, he felt very down for a long while, so I decided to introduce him to my redhead cousin - her name&#8217;s Elishevah - hoping it&#8217;ll cheer him up. He ended up liking her and he wrote a hack of that song as a love song to her, and she ended up falling in love with him, and he converted to Judaism and married her, and she&#8217;s now pregnant with their first born, and he writes more songs about her. Very good ones.</p></blockquote><p>( <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/">"So, who the hell is Qoheleth" by Shlomi Fish (= me)</a> )</p><p>Note that I employed this strategy, in real life, with an Internet friend of mine who is a retired Finnish software developer in his 40s, who lives in a small Finnish town. He shared some poems he wrote and I and other chat participants commented what we liked or disliked about them. His poetry did improve mostly consistently and&#8230; he now has a young woman living with him. I do not know what she thinks about his poems, but he's <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#make-your-own-kind-of-music">a cool guy regardless</a>.</p><hr><p>If you do not like a work, please try to comment on why you think it is lacking, rather than completely dismissing it or vaguely criticising it ( e.g: "it sucks"; "you cannot write"; "it's a waste of space"; "try to write it as if you were there" ). People are often amazed by food reviewers in the recently trendy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television#Reality_competition/game_shows">cooking competition ("reality") shows</a> being very pedantic and pinpointing small and large problems, but it comes with experience and "with the territory". So I applaud these reviewers.</p><p>Telling a contributor why you dislike their work will make reworked and future works better, and your own future job easier. Reportedly, film studios often silently dismissed screenplays that they received. I recently submitted my <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter.html">Sesame Street / "Harry Potter"</a> crossover screenplay to <a href="https://www.sesameworkshop.org/">the Sesame Workshop</a> and received no reply.</p><p>Another different approach is the canned response. While sometimes useful, it is often indicative that the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/02/19/seven-steps-to-remarkable-customer-service/">problem needs to be fixed more permanently</a>. I also recall being given a list of reasons by a web ad service for why my site was unacceptable, and they were far too vague.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="meta_be_communicative">Be communicative about changing your policy</h3></header><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association"><abbr title="Motion Picture Association">MPAA</abbr></a> should publicly announce their plans to also accept screenplays in new electronic formats with accessible linters, and to instruct their screenreaders to try be more communicative. Per <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin's Ethics</a>, I do not propose laying off the existing screenreaders.</p><p>I feel this is the current bottleneck, but the film studios should also approve of <a href="../#originality_is_self_defeating">writing commercial crossovers, parodies and RPFs</a>.</p></section></section></main>
