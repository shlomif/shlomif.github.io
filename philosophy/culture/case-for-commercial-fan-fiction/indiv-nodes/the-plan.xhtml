Note that just like Asimov's <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/changing-the-seldon-plan/">Seldon Plan</a>, this plan is not set in stone and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/ongoing-text.html">we'll likely have to improvise ("play by ear"), or adapt it to the circumstances</a>. Moreover, its items are just guidelines and suggestions, not rules and demands. Furthermore, it is likely this will not be the final challenge faced by the film industry and fiction industry or humanity as a whole, so we should not rest on our laurels.</p><p>Anyway, I suggest:</p><ol><li><p>Screenplay readers to also accept screenplays in easier to write and to get right formats, which should have open source, portable, and easy-to-install, validators and <a href="https://github.com/caramelomartins/awesome-linters">linters</a>. They should also accept and tolerate some relatively minor errors. ( <a href="../#hollywood_screenplay_format">Reference</a> ).</p></li><li><p>Copyright owners to relicense their franchises under permissive licenses (possibly unilaterally).

We now have several examples to prove that amateurs can surpass professionals, when they have the right kind of system to channel their efforts. Wikipedia may be the most famous. Experts have given Wikipedia middling reviews, but they miss the critical point: it&#8217;s good enough. And it&#8217;s free, which means people actually read it. On the web, articles you have to pay for might as well not exist. Even if you were willing to pay to read them yourself, you can&#8217;t link to them.
