Boring! Too <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_correctness">politically correct</a>!</p><p>But picture Emma Watson as <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/">Selina Mandrake</a>, a geeky Anglo-American (and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caucasian_race">Caucasian</a> naturally, and of any hair colour she fancies) 12th-grade high school student, who is unathletic and clumsy, loves playing Basketball (but "royally sucks at it"), is completely non-violent toward the demons she slays, and even shows compassion for them, and having watched the original series, finds the demonic underworld to be "quite a weird lot". She is tormented by "The Guide" ( <a href="http://wilwheaton.net/">Wil Wheaton</a> ), a mysterious American Goth-like man, who despite seeming to possess powerful magic, and mustering weapons, claims she is a far better slayer than he is. In addition, it sports some Israeli secular/Tanakh Judaism background, and a take-it-in-your-face <a href="https://buffyfanfiction.fandom.com/wiki/Selinaverse">milliards years-old "Elders of Zion"/Illuminati-like conspiracy</a> titled "The Neo-Tech Conspiracy for Establishing the Semitic Culture". It also sports a modernised take on <i>The Three Musketeers</i>, with the French-English-French "Milady" Kate Canterson being the love interest of d'Artagnan, who are both sent by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_Richelieu">Cardinal Richelieu</a>, King Louis XIII, <b>and</b> the King of England, to "slay" <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Villiers,_1st_Duke_of_Buckingham">Lord Buckingham</a> (= stage his death and have him start a new life in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_colonization_of_the_Americas">British colonies of North America</a>.).</p><p>Extremely not politically correct, which is why it is much more honest and fun and may prove more popular. <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Rules_of_Acquisition">"War is good for business!"</a> to quote the Ferengi Rules of Acquisition. And I invite <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html#cast__direction">Whedon to direct it</a>!</p><p>My secret to success: I'm a 21st century open source + <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">open/free content</a> + remixer + fanfic polymath and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=larry-wall-all-truth-is-gods-truh">openminded</a> amateur / geek, and hacker / action hero, entertainer and educator. I have my sources of inspiration and my beliefs and my opinions - I do not deny them and reuse them, but often challenge them and parody them. I'm being the "trying to be awesome or at least awesomely badass" Shlomi Fish, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZQyVUTcpM4">keeps the faith</a>, defies his fate, <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">encourages criticism</a> and yet <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Never_Try_to_Please_Everyone/">doesn't try to please everyone</a>.</p><p>If I try to please "the media" / "my profits" / society / "the rules" / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_Do_You_Care_What_Other_People_Think%3F">what other people think</a> / the guidelines and guidelines-generators too much, then no one will be pleased. If I'll be myself and <a href="../#do_it_my_way">do it my way</a>, then hopefully some people will love my work and most of the others will not remain indifferent.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/af_J2e4r328" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></section></main>
