E.g: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">open/free content</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">"web 2.0"</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">User-generated content</a>.</p><p>This makes geeky hackers increasingly think of stories and screenplays in terms of fanfiction, and wish to write them as such.</p></li><li><p>The film industry's requirement of accepting screenplays only in its draconian, finicky (and yet - boring) format. ( <a href="../#hollywood_screenplay_format">Reference</a> ).</p></li><li><p>Its lack of communication on why a screenplay has been rejected. ( <a href="../#be_communicative">Reference</a> ).</p></li><li><p>Its franchise territorialism (which hinders commercial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)">crossovers</a>). ( <a href="../#freeing_franchises">Reference</a> ).</p></li><li><p>The fact that copyright is enforced on commercial use of characters, concepts, and worlds (and to an extent - texts). ( <a href="../#freeing_franchises">Reference</a> ).</p><p>Since most popular art and culture (e.g: films, T.V. series, stories, books, songs, audios, web pages, interactive games, quotes and aphorisms, etc.) in the past decades was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">"proprietary"</a> (= restricted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved">"All rights reserved"</a>, "copyrighted"), it makes the legal status of most crossover art, iffy.</p></li><li><p>The recent antagonism against <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_person_fiction">Real Person Fiction ( RPF )</a> due to an apparent "jinxing" of celebrities from being employable as actors in commercial films, and T. V. series.</p></li></ul><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qTIGg3I5y8" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>It proposes a way forward, implementable by more than one party, that may hopefully make the film industry flourish just like the music industry (including "playing-for-fun" musicians), and the software industry. Here is the link to see <a href="../#the-plan"><b>the current plan and recommendations</b></a>.</p><p><b>Note:</b> as a writer of fan-fiction, I may be biased in handling what seems to be the lowest-hanging fruit for me.
