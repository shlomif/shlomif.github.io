If one cannot legally accept donations, then they can sell digital goods (or tangible <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNZove4OTtI">merchandice</a>) with a minimal, but not maximal price similar to the <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/">Humble Bundle</a> or <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/models-for-commerce/">bandcamp</a> models. Hacks!</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oNZove4OTtI" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>They can do it either by agreement or unilaterally. As an analogy, I recall that back in the late 1990s, there was an initial resistance by vendors of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_relational_database_management_systems">commercial SQL databases</a> to release official <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux</a> ports of their databases (which they built and supported on similar, but proprietary and costly, <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/Freenode-programming-channel-FAQ/blob/master/FAQ_with_ToC__generated.md#is-it-true-that-macos--mac-os-x-is-superior-to-linux-because-it-is-a-certified-unix">UNIX-like operating systems</a>). However, then they announced their intentions to do so one by one, and it was <a href="https://linux.slashdot.org/story/98/08/01/0948200/we-just-typed-make">technologically easy to do</a> and brought all of them many sales. And today anyone who proposes deploying a Unix-like server that does not run an open-source operating system (GNU/Linux or BSD or similar) except for running legacy applications ,<a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-sharp-programming-mac-server">is in a state of sin</a>.</p><p>Also see <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/#commercial_fanfic">my earlier thoughts</a> about commercial fan-fiction.</p><p>Copyright maximalism, and franchise territorialism, are artificial, man-made, and unnecessary problems. They can be subverted either legally, or in practice, by hacking around them. As alternatives to the more famous actors, cosplayers can play as them or one can produce lower-cost animations (including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/kaajb9/commission_fluttershy_as_queen_amidala_of_the/gfdi3b0/">MLP-style animations</a>) and solicit money for producing a live action version. One can also solicit money for <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/relicensing-my-entire-portfolio-under-cc-by/">relicensing works under less restrictive licences</a> (e.g: "CC-by-nc-sa"&#8594;"CC0").</p></section></main>
