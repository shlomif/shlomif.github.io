<!DOCTYPE html><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="better_now_by_choice">Organisations being better - by choice</h3><a class="back_to_faq" href="../#better_now_by_choice">Node Link</a></header><p>One reason the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America"><abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr></a> member companies embraced YouTube and other media sharing sites as distribution channels for their songs, was that there were enough independent musicians who provided (sometimes not too inferior and often superior) covers of the songs and didn't care too much about getting direct ad revenue. It's not as if one gets penalised for getting a million views (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos&amp;oldid=1004942122">much more</a>) rather than a mere one hundred. Furthermore, to <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=greatest-threat-to-authors">quote Tim O'Reilly</a> <q>The greatest threat to authors and creative artists is not piracy &#8212; it&#8217;s obscurity.</q>.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America"><abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr></a> member companies are happy now providing legal or financial services to signed artists and lately even actively promoting them and YouTuber singers (and the line between signed and independent artists has been getting more blurry).</p><p>As an analogy, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic</a> church used to burn at stake girls who admitted to having premarital sex even once. On the other hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna">Madonna</a>, who identifies as a Catholic, and boasted of having had premarital sex with dozens of willing men, ( and I have no reason to doubt her) was not only left unharmed, but was welcome in some of the holiest churches in Israel and the Palestinian Authority during her visit there. If you ask a Catholic clergyman if she or similar "sin"ful women should be killed again he'd likely say: <q>Dear Lord no! 'Thou shall not kill'. It's up to God to punish them if he sees fit, but we should not act as his agents.</q>. So the Roman Catholic church now is more benevolent - by choice.</p><p>More recently, the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ceiling-cat">"Ceiling cat is watching you masturbate"</a> captioned image, has stopped many preachers from using the shopworn "omniscient, omnipresent, deity [who cares about your sex life]" argument. However, to be frank, it was neither effective, nor desirable. I think there are far better insights and memes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the Hebrew Bible</a>, than that (despite being a non-observant <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/religious_belief.xhtml">agnostic</a>).</p><p>Similarly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America"><abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr></a> is not going back to the pre-YouTube /&#160;pre-"piracy" days, because even if it could, it would rather not. We need to be more creative and resourceful when reforming the fiction/drama/Hollywood/film-industry world, but I think we should try, and we likely can succeed.</p></section></main>
