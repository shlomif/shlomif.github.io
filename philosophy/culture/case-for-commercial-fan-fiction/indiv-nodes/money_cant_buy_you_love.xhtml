That is partly due to most competent (and ergo honest, <a href="../#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional">geeky, and hackery</a>) lawyers refusing to litigate for them, and by most others getting bit by unhappiness ( e.g: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinical depression</a> ), alienation from their friends and family, or by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma#Comparable_concepts">karma / "what goes around come around"</a>.</p><p>Judges are forbidden to accept "bribes" by law, but even if they did, they are getting paid enough for it to not matter and even most rich people have enough sense <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#meaning-of-able-competent">to not be too needy</a> and as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surely_You%27re_Joking,_Mr._Feynman!">Richard Feynman pointed out</a>, gifts may have an adverse effect.</p><p>As a result, I think the international financial bylaws should be changed to allow every legal entity to send any amount of money (assuming they have that amount in their balance) to any other entity, and for any purpose or reason (with a possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ledger">digital ledger</a> for historical backtracking).</p><blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Michelle_Gellar&amp;oldid=1012248078" class="fancy"><p>I started because my mother taught me a long time ago that even when you have nothing, there's ways to give back. And what you get in return for that is tenfold. But it was always hard because I couldn't do a lot. I couldn't do much more than just donate money when I was on [Buffy] because there wasn't time. And now that I have the time, it's amazing.</p></blockquote><p>( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Michelle_Gellar&amp;oldid=1012248078">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> as quoted on the English Wikipedia. )</p><p>Some people have a prejudice against donating money to corporations, especially large ones. But they and their shareholders (who receive profit dividends) are also good causes.</p></section></main>
