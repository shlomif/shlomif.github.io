And my secret plan for <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/">Queen Padm&#233; [Amidala] Tales</a> is to beget an even greater Hacker Monarch/Messiah, who despite being fictional, is an awe-inspiring Renaissance Woman. But she too will likely not be the final word about Messiah-hood just like <a href="http://www.earthstar.co.uk/deep1.htm">Deep Thought</a> is only the "second greatest computer in the Universe of Time and Space". Like <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">Moses, Socrates, Muhammad, Saladin, da Vinci, Newton, Richelieu, Dumas, Verne, The Beatles, The Muppets, etc,</a> were succeeded, so will Queen Padm&#233; Amidala of the Naboo of the Selinaverse. And it seems likely that people had once taken Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Saladin, Richelieu, or Dumas not as seriously as some people later took The Muppets, The Beatles, Buffy, or the Web 2.0 Bloggers, or xkcd.</p></section></main>
