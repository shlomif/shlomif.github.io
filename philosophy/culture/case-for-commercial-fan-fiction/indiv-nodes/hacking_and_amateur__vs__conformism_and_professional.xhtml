As I show, this implies most new quality screenplays and stories are currently and are going to increasingly not only be fanfiction but also crossovers, parodies, and/or real person fiction - usually including recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">"proprietary"</a> (= restricted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved">"All rights reserved"</a>, "copyrighted") franchises and recent (and often living) real people. And they aren't being written in the finicky, hard to get right, and boring <a href="../#hollywood_screenplay_format">Hollywood-blessed screenplay format</a>, and geeks will increasingly stop sending drafts or proposals to <a href="../#be_communicative">non-communicative</a> reviewers.</p><p>One thing I got wrong is thinking a geek will refuse to get paid. Perhaps it was true for amateurs and geeks before the advent of Capitalism, but is no longer true now. That is wrong, as of 2021, because often, geeks are now offered large amounts of money or at least token pay. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, who is a software developer, an action hero, a geek, and <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">a remarkable amateur philosopher and entertainer</a>, is believed to get paid 20 million USD/year. While he will gladly continue to comaintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel project</a> for less, it is commonly accepted that it is a reasonable salary to give him.</p><p>Moreover, attractive actors (including female actresses and/or inexperienced and obscure ones and/or formerly big name ones) are also geeky hackers. As a result, they will not play in any badly written film (and usually a dystopian, ending badly, pessimistic, politically correct and dishonest one) even for all the money in the world.</p><p>Geeks are not to be confused with "dorks" who are (for the context of this essay) people without social life, or who seem reckless, not confident, unattractive, etc. Moreover, "amateur" now has pejorative meaning of something done poorly or non-skillfully but in the 19th century, it was a compliment.</p><p>The word "nerd" can mean either "geek" or "dork".</p><p>These were contrasted to "professionalism" (= doing something only for money, regardless of how little or a lot: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJrqpR_7VSo">"We're not just doing it for money!&#8230;We're doing it for a shitload of money"</a>; not enjoying your work).</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJrqpR_7VSo" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>A geek may agree to do some tasks that are not too enjoyable as part of their job. There is also the old <a href="https://shlomifish.livejournal.com/1747.html">Stoic method</a> of trying not to hate a task and even allowing oneself to enjoy it. This is reflected in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftxnr28LDXc">the "spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down" scene</a> from Disney's <i>Mary Poppins</i>. However, if the job is destructive and pointless, e.g one that stands against the contemporary <a href="../#open_free_share_steal">"open / free / share"</a> ideals, then it can never be enjoyable.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="what_is_hacking">What is &#8220;hacking&#8221;?</h3></header><p>I also contrasted "conformism" (= playing by the rules of "society", what other people expect you to do, following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">superior orders</a>, doing what you feel you are obliged to do, etc.) to "hacking" (a.k.a "action heroism"). Hacking is not limited to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_hacker">computer security exploitation</a>, or even to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_culture">creative software development</a>.</p><p>Hacking involves:</p><ol><li><p>Thinking outside the box. (&#160;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMz7JBRbmNo"><q>Both cups were poisoned. I had developed an immunity for the poison.</q></a> )</p></li><li><p>Being resourceful.</p></li><li><p>Finding creative solutions.</p></li><li><p>Bending or defying the "laws"/guidelines.</p></li><li><p>Not accepting your "fate".</p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">"David vs. Goliath"</a> and its <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/hacking-heroism.xhtml">"Indiana Jones' Gun vs. Swordmaster" scene</a> modernisation (which is funny now, and the Goliath story was likely equally as funny in ancient times). Moreover, the real-life <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a> became "the child who slew two mighty superpowers", at the age of 10, by using international mail, and other 20th century technology (and not killing anyone).</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anEuw8F8cpE" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></li><li id="craziness_and_nevua"><p>"Craziness" / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevi%27im">Nev'ua</a> ( which was mistranslated as "prophecy"). I suspect "lenab&#233;" in Biblical times originally meant to "act crazy", to "drive crazy", "to be crazy", "to seek [divine] guidance", including in today's casual senses. It involved: "funny"ness, exaggeration, song-and-poetry, emulation, contradicting one self, <a href="https://mlp.fandom.com/wiki/Luna_Eclipsed">intimidation and fear (which can be fun in a way)</a> - even blasphemy. Many <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MOTAS">Members of the appropriate sex</a> nevertheless found it sexy.</p><p>Plato considered insanity as divine, and during his time, the good "stand-up philosophers" or nevi'im (and many similar phenomena in the Near East), were often funny, or otherwise exciting, exalting, non "original" (borrowed and built upon the works of their peers and predecessors), often seemingly or actually contradicted themselves, blasphemous or just seemingly "stupid", and didn't take themselves seriously. Although held with <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/image-macros/#pbride_philosophers">some contempt</a>, they were highly coveted by <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/MOTAS">Members of the appropriate sex</a>.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tl4VD8uvgec" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bicameralism_(psychology)">Julian Jaynes</a> hypothesised that the Nevi'im were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia">Schizophrenic</a> and hallucinated voices of "gods" (= <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/psychology/crossover-hypothesis-about-the-origin-of-consciousness/">"guidelines-generators"</a>) and who spoke in poems or rhymes. However, now I think most of the later ones were only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanic</a> (= mild-mania) at worst, often spoke in prose or in free form verse, and often not only emulated, built-upon, parodied, or mocked their predecessors or contemporaries, but topped them.</p><p>And they were often accused of being <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/image-macros/#standup_philosopher">"bullshit" artists</a>, being blasphemous or stupid, and "contaminating the minds of the youth" and held in some contempt. Socrates, Galileo, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Dumas">Alexandre Dumas</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>, early films and film cartoons ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney">Walt Disney</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warner_Bros.">Warner Bros</a>, etc.) television in the 1970s (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street"><i>Sesame Street</i></a> / etc.), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_game">video games</a> starting from the 1980s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game">Role-playing games</a>, Internet chat ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat"><abbr title="Internet Relay Chat">IRC</abbr></a> / etc.), supermodels, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television">reality TV</a> show contestants, independent YouTube cover/etc. artists, bloggers, and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#departing_pope_about_twitter">social media</a>. Like Qoheleth noted around 300 B.C.: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">"There is nothing new under the sun."</a></p><p>Just for the record, while I am enamoured with many YouTube cover artists, and whose songs comprise of most of the music I listen to, my sister, who is 5 years my junior and who has a Ph.D. in Computer Science (so she is intelligent and techsavvy), has a prejudice against them.</p></li><li><p>The Biblical <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samson">Samson</a> was <strong>not</strong> in general an action hero, but a classical "I'm taking them all with me" / <a href="https://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt0716.htm#28">"may my soul perish with philistines"</a> tragic hero, who worked hard (and not smart!) and took many lives of (often innocent) people who cared about him.</p></li><li><p>Naturally, when software developers say "I hacked a Python script" or "The Linux kernel is a great hack" they mean that they were created or concieved with pleasure. The Ancient Hebrew verb <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%99%D7%93%D7%A2">&#1497;&#1491;&#1506; ("yada`", "lada`at")</a> meant both "to know" and to "have had sex with". However, I hypothesised that it also meant "to create something with joy" and a linguist friend confirmed that. A female software developer who paid me to teach her <a href="https://perl-begin.org/">the Perl programming language</a> told me that writing a Perl script felt like giving birth for her.</p><p>As a result, I think "yada`" had some of the contemporary meaning of "hacking" despite some etymological erosion.</p><p>This corresponds with the <a href="../#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional">"amateur" / "geeky" nature</a> of workers loving/enjoying their work.</p><p>Also note that hacking sometimes <b>does</b> involve a prolonged and intense amount of work as opposed to the <a href="../#david_and_goliath">David vs. Goliath 's "taking the easy way out"</a>. David for example had likely spent many hours practicing his slingshot skills and honing them.</p></li><li><p>That put aside, despite common belief, <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/fact-or-fiction-nasa-spen/">NASA astronauts did use pencils in space at first</a>, just like their Soviet peers. However, this solution was found to be lacking. As a result, space-friendly pens were developed (within budget) and used (including by the USSR cosmonauts).</p></li></ol><p>Like the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Fish,_Two_Fish,_Red_Fish,_Blue_Fish">"One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish"</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There%27s_more_than_one_way_to_do_it">"There's more than one way to do it"</a>, adage indicate, there are many kinds of <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">hacker monarchs</a> (= "master hackers", "hacker kings/hacker queens", "messiahs") and looks or qualities can be deceiving.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="geeks_and_hackers_are_cool">Geeks and Hackers are the Mainstream &#8220;Cool Kids&#8221;</h3></header><p>Traditionally (as of 2021), there was an apparent dichotomy between geek and hacker culture and "mainstream" culture. Geeks were considered intelligent, but unattractive, shy, anti-social, unathletic, and often without "real-life" social life. My 2005 <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/conclusions/">"The Human Hacking Field Guide"</a> story presented male and female open source and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">open/free content</a> geeks and hackers as competent, confident, sexually attractive, socially capable, assertive, as well as popular and coveted. It was written as an antithesis to Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">"Why Nerds are Unpopular" essay</a> and the <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html">Buffyesque false social dichotomy</a>. Some commentators claimed it was detrimental, because the target demographic for "open source"/etc. geeks was the social outcasts, "uncool" kids.</p><p>However, by the time the first season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a> aired during late 2007, it was an established observation that geeks and hackers were the Alphas. Moreover, I believe that its primary "anti-Geek" character, <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Penny">Penny</a>, despite her "hot dumb blonde girl" image, and her ignorance and laymanship, was a superb hacker and geek. This is because she constantly challenged and broke the hidden rules of the show's more stigmatic (and less attractive looking) geeks, and because she was passionate and enthusiastic about many of her endeavours. Moreover, she is often depicted as trying to emulate the nerdier/dorkier geeks, and successfully.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ufr-Y5oROyE" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Given <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/Captioned-Image-Badass-Schwarzenegger">"one needs to be a badass to play one on T.V."</a>, I'm pretty sure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaley_Cuoco">Kaley Cuoco</a>, the actress who portrayed Penny, is a hacker and a geek as well.</p><blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1364839109068541958" class="fancy"><p>First people were prejudiced about new/old.
