( Even if they do not have a conscious policy against starring in pessimistic screenplays, they will be so poorly written or depressing or boring, that they will "subconsciously" avoid them. )</p><p><a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/#emma_watson">Emma Watson being unhirable as an actress in Hollywood</a> started as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjSq4P3CQO0&amp;lc=UgjsAzT0hsSJFHgCoAEC.8RpGmv74hcW9-2qZLWNK2f">a snarky youtube comment</a> I wrote, which some people found funny, but which materialised after the film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women_(2019_film)">Little Women (2019)</a>. Although loved by professional critics, geeky fans like me thought that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Women_(1994_film)">1994 adaptation starring Winona Rider</a> was still pertinent today, and that Watson was underutilised.</p><p>She has not accepted a "major motion picture" role since, possibly because she'd rather play at local parody plays, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Con_Man_(web_series)">frequent Conventions ("cons")</a>, play in indie films, get paid for modelling, be an activist, acquire new skills, or just relax, than get paid to star in a poorly written and professional (and likely dystopian or pessimistic) Hollywood remake or original film. Lend me Emma Watson and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jennifer_Lawrence">Jennifer Lawrence</a> and I'll return both with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Portman_filmography">Natalie Portman</a> as interest! Whether or not Portman is going to accept being cast as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)">Thor(ah)</a> that will be the last film the territorially-franchised film industry will see of her.</p><p>(For reference, see <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/teaser/">this teaser for "Queen Padm&#233; [Amidala] Tales"</a>, and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Queen-Padme-Tales/">the Queen Padm&#233; [Amidala] Tales fanfic</a> itself, both sporting Portman.)</p><blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1344164824910016513" class="fancy"><ul><li><p>"When I was your age, <a href="https://twitter.com/EmmaWatson">@EmmaWatson</a> was called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Bernhardt">Sarah Bernhardt</a>."</p></li><li><p>"Dude! How old are you?"</p></li></ul><p>It's funny to think that Em is the canonical "Alpha Female" now, but Bernhardt being the daughter of a (Jewish) prostitute, whose father's identity was unclear, was far more questionable.
