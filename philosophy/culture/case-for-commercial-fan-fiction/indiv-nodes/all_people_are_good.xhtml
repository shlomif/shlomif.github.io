Even historical mass-murderers (e.g: Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Genghis Khan, Attila the Hun, Alexander of Macedonia, even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebuchadnezzar_II">Nebuchadnezzar</a>) provided some redeeming actions or wisdom. See for instance <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/top-10-reasons-darth-vader-amazing-project-manager/">"Top 10 reasons why Darth Vader was an amazing project manager"</a> with an easy (but tabooed) "Darth Vader"&#8658;"Nazi Germany's leadership" substitution.</p><p>Since I have at least subconsciously (and lately consciously) believed everyone can improve and change, and grow (see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect">Pygmalion effect</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_effect">the Golem effect</a>) and treated them like that, they eventually usually did improve.</p><p>My mother told me once "There are no bad people - only bad actions". Moreover, the iconic Israeli homeless man, "Ayalon Dude", (see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtUJVg2nCzk">an interview with him in Hebrew</a>) once proposed her to marry him, because she treated him with respect and friendliness. She naturally refused because she was and still is happily married (to my father).</p><p>As a result, I don't think that Hollywood producers, executives, lawyers, directors, and other workers are evil (or alternatively USA/etc. government, parliament, legal system, etc. workers are) - just possibly misguided.</p><p>Moreover, changing your future is often easy given <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/religious_belief.xhtml">free will</a> and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#big-minded-vs-small-minded">refusing superior orders</a> and hacking around the <a href="../#guidelines_as_dogma">guidelines</a> (even "rules" or "laws").</p><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="starved_of_employees">Businesses Being Starved of Competent Employees</h3></header><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond">Eric S. Raymond</a> and I have <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/shlomif-tech-diary/blob/master/esr-deprecate-windows.md">a hypothesis</a> that Microsoft wishes to deprecate the original Microsoft Windows Internals, and gradually replace them with an open source reimplementation based on Linux. That is because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization">optimising</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactoring</a>, or otherwise enhancing them, have been made more and more discouraged due to the (possibly justified) policy to <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/06/13/how-microsoft-lost-the-api-war/">not break legacy 3rd-party applications</a> (including many old ones or ones with no source available). Programmers and other software developers who wish to work on them, whether young, old, experienced, or inexperienced, are thus frustrated at the process' lack of flexibility and agility that they become unhappy, aggravated and complain. Other obstacles are the iffy legal status of the codebase, which prevents opensourcing it like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET_Core">.NET Core</a>, and its reported lack of elegance.</p><p>Given these developers can easily find many other openings as software developers or other high paying jobs (including on different teams within Microsoft) and increasingly wish to enjoy their work (being <a href="../#geek_def">geeks or "amateurs"</a>), the team is starved of competent, and enthusiastic workers. Even if Microsoft still sells Windows copies, they are being starved of employees.</p><p><b>Note:</b> Microsoft has many other products and services, many of them are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)</a> and/or provide important services or infrastructure for open source, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">open/free content</a>, or otherwise geeky, hackery or important projects. So I do not wish to completely demonise them. In fact, I make use of some of the Microsoft-owned <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub">GitHub</a> infrastructure for many projects of mine, including my home-site, and it seems the user experience of GitHub improved since the acquisition by Microsoft, and I am also a fan of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TypeScript">TypeScript</a>.</p><p id="smartphone_wars">Lawyers have been demonised, but I think most of the lawyers employed by the offenses in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smartphone_patent_wars">Smartphone patent wars</a> asked for a reassignment or quit in disgust, or they will. These "Smartphone wars" are a rerun of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Jennens">"Jennens vs. Jennens" court case</a> which gave many lawyers more work to do and made them a little richer, but made them more miserable:</p><blockquote class="fancy"><p>William Jennens (possibly Jennings) (1701&#8211;1798)&#8230; was a reclusive financier who lived at Acton Place in the village of Acton, Suffolk, England. He was described as the "richest commoner in England" when he died unmarried and intestate with a fortune estimated at &#163;2 million, which became the subject of legal wrangles (Jennens vs Jennens) in the Court of Chancery for well over a century until the entire estate had been swallowed by lawyers' fees.</p></blockquote><p>There is a reason that most lawsuits are settled out of court: the reputation, angst, and happiness losses involved in them are too paramount.</p><p>A capable geek and hacker, will quickly enter <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinical depression</a> when working on destructive tasks, and this includes lawyers and politicians and clergymen and socialites - even accountants. Someone told me of a documentary showing almost empty Silicon Valley office spaces of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll">patent trolls</a> as most of their workers quit in frustration (also see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karma#Comparable_concepts">karma / "what goes around come around"</a>). Even if a firm doing destructive tasks is not starved of customers, they will be starved of employees.</p><hr><p id="takedown_notices">I suspect the recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl">RIAA (= "Recording Industry Association of America") takedown request against youtube-dl's GitHub repository</a> was done by a techsavvy lawyer employee of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America"><abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr></a>, who had the legal capability to file it on behalf of the RIAA as a whole, and hoped to save future work this way. This is given the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America"><abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr></a> <a href="https://boingboing.net/2004/11/06/save-canadas-interne.html">foolishly sends takedown notices</a> to many publicly accessible web sites that host media files downloaded using youtube-dl and similar tools ( <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/Files/files/">Piracy, motherfucker! Do you speak it? Arrrrrr!!</a> ), and they are kept being protested and challenged.</p><p>He or she may have been scolded by their executives, but do note <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/The_Nagus_(episode)">Quark's approving reaction to Rom (= his brother and employee) attempting to murder him</a> in a Star Trek DS9 episode. I think the real solution is to completely stop sending these takedown notices and <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/case-for-file-swapping/">accept piracy as a necessary "evil"</a> (and possibly sponsor better user interfaces for file sharing sites and practice less censorship).</p><p>There is an ongoing transition to <a href="../#hacking_and_amateur__vs__conformism_and_professional">the geeks and hackers' culture</a>, which no one can stop ( see <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/"><i>Summmerschool at the NSA</i></a> ) and a <a href="../#open_free_share_steal">trend towards openness, freedom, and sharing</a> of cultural / code / scientific / tangible works. Thus, the film industry is starving itself, both of competent screenwriters and individual screenplays, and of <a href="../#beautiful_people_are_geeks">attractive and competent actors</a>, both male and female, and both those that haven't yet appeared in any major roles <b>as well as</b> experienced and highly acclaimed ones.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="better_now_by_choice">Organisations being better - by choice</h3></header><p>One reason the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America"><abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr></a> member companies embraced YouTube and other media sharing sites as distribution channels for their songs, was that there were enough independent musicians who provided (sometimes not too inferior and often superior) covers of the songs and didn't care too much about getting direct ad revenue. It's not as if one gets penalised for getting a million views (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_most-viewed_YouTube_videos&amp;oldid=1004942122">much more</a>) rather than a mere one hundred. Furthermore, to <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=greatest-threat-to-authors">quote Tim O'Reilly</a> <q>The greatest threat to authors and creative artists is not piracy &#8212; it&#8217;s obscurity.</q>.</p><p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America"><abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr></a> member companies are happy now providing legal or financial services to signed artists and lately even actively promoting them and YouTuber singers (and the line between signed and independent artists has been getting more blurry).</p><p>As an analogy, The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church">Roman Catholic</a> church used to burn at stake girls who admitted to having premarital sex even once. On the other hand, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna">Madonna</a>, who identifies as a Catholic, and boasted of having had premarital sex with dozens of willing men, ( and I have no reason to doubt her) was not only left unharmed, but was welcome in some of the holiest churches in Israel and the Palestinian Authority during her visit there. If you ask a Catholic clergyman if she or similar "sin"ful women should be killed again he'd likely say: <q>Dear Lord no! 'Thou shall not kill'. It's up to God to punish them if he sees fit, but we should not act as his agents.</q>. So the Roman Catholic church now is more benevolent - by choice.</p><p>More recently, the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ceiling-cat">"Ceiling cat is watching you masturbate"</a> captioned image, has stopped many preachers from using the shopworn "omniscient, omnipresent, deity [who cares about your sex life]" argument. However, to be frank, it was neither effective, nor desirable. I think there are far better insights and memes in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the Hebrew Bible</a>, than that (despite being a non-observant <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/religious_belief.xhtml">agnostic</a>).</p><p>Similarly, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America"><abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr></a> is not going back to the pre-YouTube /&#160;pre-"piracy" days, because even if it could, it would rather not. We need to be more creative and resourceful when reforming the fiction/drama/Hollywood/film-industry world, but I think we should try, and we likely can succeed.</p></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="guidelines_as_dogma">Taking Guidelines as Dogma is the Problem</h3></header><blockquote cite="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=emacs-wars" class="fancy"><p>I've heard a Jew and a Muslim argue in a Damascus caf&#233; with less passion than the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editor_war">Emacs wars</a>.</p><p>&#8212; Ronald Florence</p></blockquote><p>The main issue is people treating rules / laws / "orders from above" / what other people think / social norms / <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/comments/364868137">scientific 'facts'</a> - even religious decrees or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_United_States">the American Constitution</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic">laws of Logic</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">those of maths</a> as absolutes and dogma rather than as mere <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Rules_are_Just_Guidelines/">guidelines</a>.</p><p>I met open-minded, enlightened, even self-critical, observant Jews, Christians, or Muslims (and a Sri-Lankan woman, who took care of my grandmother during her later years, identifies as <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/thought_you_were_a_Perl_guy.xhtml">both a Christian and a Buddhist</a>). I also met close-minded and "professionally fanatic" <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> fans, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic">My Little Pony</a> fans or haters (see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mylittlepony/comments/kaa7wl/swimming_lessons_by_vergolophus/gfa1udh/">this thread for instance</a>), and professional <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TMNT/comments/2d9fo7/postrelease_movie_discussion_thread_2/"><i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> fans</a>.

Generations of scholars who considered it holy have tried to divine meaning from it, but it is pointless: Ezekiel was just <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=mjd-how-to-ask-a-good-question-1">making shit up</a>.</p><p>I also suspect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_(Plato)">Plato&#8217;s "Republic"</a> was similarly half tongue-in-cheek by Plato who described how he thought a country really <b>should not</b> be run.
