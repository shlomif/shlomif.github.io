<!DOCTYPE html><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="bad_acting_shlomif">My Hacky Acting Story</h3><a class="back_to_faq" href="../#bad_acting_shlomif">Node Link</a></header><p>Now for a personal story: back when I was in the 7th or the 8th grades (I am 1977-born, so it was around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulf_War">the first Gulf War</a>; ~1990), my classroom studied a Hebrew translation of Moli&#232;re's play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Misanthrope">The Misanthrope</a> as part of our "Literature" studies and my classmates took turns reading the lines. One day I was assigned to read the lines of the titular character, and whereas most of my peers read their lines without excitement, I was enthusiastically envigorating the role with much fake emotion. I became a hit and almost monopolised that role.</p><p>One reason I did that was that at the time, I was more oriented toward Maths and other exact sciences, and because in Israel, one's 7th/8th grade Literature grades have little effect on their scholastic aptitude. So I had little to lose.</p><p>Anyway, I recall playing the close-to-the-finish monologue where I was lamenting the disappearance of my character's treasure box. I felt I acted unnaturally, but it was still fun, and my classmates gave me an enthusiastic ovation.</p><p>My performances there are lost in the proverbial <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akashic_records">Akashic records</a> because they were not recorded. Furthermore, for better or for worse, I was a web worker and writer, during the early days of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web">the Web (WWW)</a>, an amateur graphics manipulator, and a professional software developer (who also has done <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/">for-fun/"amateur", open source, software development work</a>). This has given me an edge over laymen who used Microsoft Word during the web 1.0 and the early <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">web 2.0</a> periods when text, limitedly formatted HTML, and images (GIFs and JPEGs mostly) were prevalent due to technological limitations (e.g: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_wars">the browser wars</a> and Microsoft holding back <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_6">Internet Explorer 6</a> development, and low speed Internet connections. ).</p></section></main>
