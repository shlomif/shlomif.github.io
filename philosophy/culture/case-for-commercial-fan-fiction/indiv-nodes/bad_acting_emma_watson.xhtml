She was overemotional, edgy, and acted in a manner which was both easier, more fun, and was loved by the geeky audience (whether in the cinemas, or at home). In a way, she was one of the few selling points of most of the series' films, which although skillfully executed, were clearly not done by artists having fun. This apparently changed with the 7th and 8th installments which were reportedly edgy and fun to watch.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NcE83Txe-3g" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></section></main>
