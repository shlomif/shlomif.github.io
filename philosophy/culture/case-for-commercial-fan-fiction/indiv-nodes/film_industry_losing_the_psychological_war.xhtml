I think it's because more and more screenwriters (including to a large extent the big name directors and producers such as Whedon or Lucas themselves) were touched by the "dark side" of the <a href="../#open_free_share_steal">open / remix</a> trend and started <a href="../#originality_is_self_defeating">thinking in terms of fanfics of recent franchises</a> and:</p><ol><li><p>Refusing to write in the Hollywood format ( <a href="../#hollywood_screenplay_format">Reference</a> ).</p></li><li><p>Cannot stand the lack of communication of screenplay readers ( <a href="../#be_communicative">Reference</a> ).</p></li><li><p>Are frustrated at the prospect of taking the time to avoid de-fanficcing the screenplay ideas from elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">"proprietary"</a> (= restricted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved">"All rights reserved"</a>, "copyrighted")franchises, and reducing the quality of the result.
