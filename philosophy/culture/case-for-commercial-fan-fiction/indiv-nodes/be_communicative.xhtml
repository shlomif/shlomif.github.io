So he ended up improving slowly but surely, until he wrote a truly great poem about her, and people loved it.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> Then Phoebe &#8212; that&#8217;s her name &#8212; told him, while crying, that she loved the song, but that she still is not going to marry him.</p><p><strong class="sayer">Alexis:</strong> The Bitch!</p><p><strong class="sayer">Josephus:</strong> My thoughts exactly. Anyway, he felt very down for a long while, so I decided to introduce him to my redhead cousin - her name&#8217;s Elishevah - hoping it&#8217;ll cheer him up. He ended up liking her and he wrote a hack of that song as a love song to her, and she ended up falling in love with him, and he converted to Judaism and married her, and she&#8217;s now pregnant with their first born, and he writes more songs about her. Very good ones.</p></blockquote><p>( <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/So-Who-The-Hell-Is-Qoheleth/">"So, who the hell is Qoheleth" by Shlomi Fish (= me)</a> )</p><p>Note that I employed this strategy, in real life, with an Internet friend of mine who is a retired Finnish software developer in his 40s, who lives in a small Finnish town. He shared some poems he wrote and I and other chat participants commented what we liked or disliked about them. His poetry did improve mostly consistently and&#8230; he now has a young woman living with him. I do not know what she thinks about his poems, but he's <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#make-your-own-kind-of-music">a cool guy regardless</a>.</p><hr><p>If you do not like a work, please try to comment on why you think it is lacking, rather than completely dismissing it or vaguely criticising it ( e.g: "it sucks"; "you cannot write"; "it's a waste of space"; "try to write it as if you were there" ). People are often amazed by food reviewers in the recently trendy <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reality_television#Reality_competition/game_shows">cooking competition ("reality") shows</a> being very pedantic and pinpointing small and large problems, but it comes with experience and "with the territory". So I applaud these reviewers.</p><p>Telling a contributor why you dislike their work will make reworked and future works better, and your own future job easier. Reportedly, film studios often silently dismissed screenplays that they received. I recently submitted my <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter.html">Sesame Street / "Harry Potter"</a> crossover screenplay to <a href="https://www.sesameworkshop.org/">the Sesame Workshop</a> and received no reply.</p><p>Another different approach is the canned response. While sometimes useful, it is often indicative that the <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2007/02/19/seven-steps-to-remarkable-customer-service/">problem needs to be fixed more permanently</a>. I also recall being given a list of reasons by a web ad service for why my site was unacceptable, and they were far too vague.</p></section></main>
