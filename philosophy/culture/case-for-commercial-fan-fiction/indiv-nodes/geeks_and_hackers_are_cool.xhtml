<!DOCTYPE html><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="geeks_and_hackers_are_cool">Geeks and Hackers are the Mainstream &#8220;Cool Kids&#8221;</h3><a class="back_to_faq" href="../#geeks_and_hackers_are_cool">Node Link</a></header><p>Traditionally (as of 2021), there was an apparent dichotomy between geek and hacker culture and "mainstream" culture. Geeks were considered intelligent, but unattractive, shy, anti-social, unathletic, and often without "real-life" social life. My 2005 <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/conclusions/">"The Human Hacking Field Guide"</a> story presented male and female open source and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">open/free content</a> geeks and hackers as competent, confident, sexually attractive, socially capable, assertive, as well as popular and coveted. It was written as an antithesis to Paul Graham's <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html">"Why Nerds are Unpopular" essay</a> and the <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html">Buffyesque false social dichotomy</a>. Some commentators claimed it was detrimental, because the target demographic for "open source"/etc. geeks was the social outcasts, "uncool" kids.</p><p>However, by the time the first season of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Big_Bang_Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a> aired during late 2007, it was an established observation that geeks and hackers were the Alphas. Moreover, I believe that its primary "anti-Geek" character, <a href="https://bigbangtheory.fandom.com/wiki/Penny">Penny</a>, despite her "hot dumb blonde girl" image, and her ignorance and laymanship, was a superb hacker and geek. This is because she constantly challenged and broke the hidden rules of the show's more stigmatic (and less attractive looking) geeks, and because she was passionate and enthusiastic about many of her endeavours. Moreover, she is often depicted as trying to emulate the nerdier/dorkier geeks, and successfully.</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ufr-Y5oROyE" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>Given <a href="https://github.com/shlomif/Captioned-Image-Badass-Schwarzenegger">"one needs to be a badass to play one on T.V."</a>, I'm pretty sure that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaley_Cuoco">Kaley Cuoco</a>, the actress who portrayed Penny, is a hacker and a geek as well.</p><blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1364839109068541958" class="fancy"><p>First people were prejudiced about new/old. Then about popular/unpopular. Now they are about "mainstream"ness: <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=two-kinds-of-fools">"Two kinds of fools"</a>. Let's just kill prejudice once and for all! When I described Kate in <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><i>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</i></a> as a socialite, I was attacked. But what's wrong with being a socialite?</p></blockquote><p>( <a href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1364839109068541958">@shlomif (= me) tweet</a> )</p><p>I still resent the fact that many hardcore geeks looked down on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">the <i>Friends</i> T.V. show</a> due to its "mainstream" image, at the time.</p><p>Moreover, some self-proclaimed "atheists" completely dismiss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the Jewish Bible</a> due to its text and style reflecting the mentality of the time.</p><p>Some people love to hate <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a>, or <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/joel-on-software.html">Joel on Software</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_S._Raymond">Eric S. Raymond</a>, who while I never completely agreed with everything they said (and they may have been proven wrong in time), often found them of useful food for thought (and none of them claimed what they say is <a href="../#guidelines_as_dogma">gospel</a> or that it will remain accurate as time and technology advance).</p></section></main>
