Then I realised: this is my life. I'm not going to waste my time trying to be something I'm not. I'm gonna be fearless. I'm going to take control, and I'm going to do it my way.</p></blockquote><p>( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FktDDKNrWjk">"Renegade" by Cimorelli.</a> )</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FktDDKNrWjk" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>I care more about getting my <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">screenplays</a> filmed and produced than I do about being recognised as an innovative and influential, yet obscure and "invisible" <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html">"hacker king" or "messiah"</a> of the Web 2.0 / <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">open/free content</a> revolution.</p><p>And I care even more about flesh-and-blood people not dying physically and prematurely for whatever reason, or otherwise get physically injured, usually by their own mismanagement. I also want every individual and organisation in the world to improve and prosper ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect">Pygmalion effect</a> vs. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_effect">the Golem effect</a>; <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-fact-chuck-156"><q>Chuck Norris was challenged to fight the world, and accepted. He bet on himself, won, and collected the bet money.</q></a>; <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-fact-sglau-29"><q>Summer Glau can get more with a kind word alone than Al Capone could with a kind word and a gun.</q></a>. )</p><p>I was probably too young to prevent the death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a>, one of the youngest known hacker monarchs up to her time. I believe she died because in her later career as a child actress, she didn't insist on doing things her way, until she was killed by a private nighttime flight plane crash, which she took due to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris">hubris</a> and impatience.</p><p>I am however saddened that I didn't prevent the premature death of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie</a> at age 22 in 2016, who was a singer, songwriter, and YouTube indie artist. I and others expected her to dominate the music world, or perhaps the whole world at large, for years to come (and become a <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">"hacker monarch"/Messiah</a> so to speak). She was killed by an obsessed fan, who shot her, and who committed suicide shortly after shooting her. I believe her death was also caused by her not doing things her way, which made her later work gradually deteriorate, her sex-appeal (which <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/meaning-of-able-competent.xhtml#sexiness-as-competence">correlates with competence</a>) to decline, and she not remaining true to her YouTuber roots (e.g: of she doing collaborations with other artists, including the more obscure ones). She acted in one film before she died, but even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aH_6CQso2qQ">its trailer</a> was a complete turnoff to me.</p><hr><p>Therefore I decided that in my quests to advocate commercial fan-fiction, and get my screenplays directed, I will do things my way. I shall remain living with my parents in <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/where_are_you_from.xhtml">their apartment</a> and will not venture far away from my neighbourhood (= <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramat_Aviv_Gimel">Ramat Aviv Gimel</a>, in northern Tel Aviv, in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel">Israel</a>) unescorted. I plan to continue writing and mutating screenplays using <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/XML-Grammar/Fiction/">my own home-grown format</a>, at least until I find or devise a better one, and write a semi-automatic converter.</p><p>I plan to <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/release_something_perfect.xhtml">release early and often</a>, and not delete content from my sites that some others disapprove of. (Though I may add notes that I take it back.)</p><p>I may have competition, but not only will I encourage them to try to outcompete me, but I will even try to help them. I don't <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law">want to be a dick</a> and suggest that neither should you. I want to "win" and become rich and famous (and respected and admired), but setting artificial obstacles in the way of my peers, or people who still (unfortunately IMHO) see themselves as inferior to me, will backfire in the end, and will make me feel guilty and remorse and not <a href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin-like</a>.</p><p>I thought I invented illustrated screenplays, "by need", but recently saw the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_pen_is_mightier_than_the_sword&amp;oldid=998361214">illustration on Edward Bulwer-Lytton's stage play "Richelieu"</a> after I searched the web for his "The pen is mightier than the sword" adage.</p><p>Furthermore, a fellow writer, who was less techsavvy than I was at the time (and wished to remain ignorant of software development) told me that "[hyper-]linking is not writing". However, not only did the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Hebrew Bible</a> had hyperlinks of sorts (references to other works), but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-canonical_books_referenced_in_the_Bible">many are currently broken</a>.</p><p>Also note that there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qere_and_Ketiv">known spelling mistakes</a> in the canonical text of the Hebrew Bible, so it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfection#Paradoxes">imperfect</a>.</p><p>So linking <b>is</b> writing, and I am going to continue adding hyperlinks to my writings.</p></section></main>
