This time I'll also add mythical / fictional heroic figures to the mix (which many <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/are_you_aware_that_the_jewish_bible_is_fictional.xhtml">people unjustly dismiss</a>. )</p><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="dedications_living">Living</h3></header><ul><li><p>This crossover essay has a strong reliance on memes from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mel_Brooks">Mel Brooks</a>'s films, especially Spaceballs.

I consider Buffy to be the <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">hacker monarch</a> of the brief "Web 1.0" period, comparable to Saladin, The Muppets, Jules Verne and The Beatles. Unfortunately, the growing prevalence of the Internet and the web (and the <a href="../#open_free_share_steal">"open" / remix</a> culture) combined with some unfortunate mismanagement decisions (Buffy not ending at high school graduation, <a href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith</a> being placed in a coma, and the show stopping being aired in Israel and possibly other countries) started spelling doom on it. While Gellar was <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/biggest_celeb_crush.xhtml">my biggest celebrity crush</a>, a role model, and the "queen of the (1.0) Web", she was dethroned by Natalie Portman soon after that, who in turn gave way to Jennifer Lopez, Beyonc&#233; Knowles, and Paris Hilton.</p><p>Like I note, I suspect the creativity crisis of the film industry is caused by its operational and legal policies, and film makers like Whedon are not immune to their psychological effects.</p><p><a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/by-others/hitchhiker-guide-to-star-trek-tng.html">"The Hitchhiker's Guide to Star Trek - The Next Generation"</a> had already been written in 1990 and circulated by email, and I found it even funnier than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy">the original H2G2</a>. The web 1.0 and especially <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User-generated_content">User-generated content</a> only amplified the "problem", and I had no qualms of writing <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/">my Friends / Fountainhead crossover</a> back in 1998. My <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/">Star Trek: &#8220;We, the Living Dead&#8221;</a> is an even "worse" crossover problem.</p></li></ul></section><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="dedications_for_deceased">Dedications for the deceased</h3></header><ul><li><p>I only knew <a href="https://www.tributearchive.com/obituaries/17755171/Kurt-Stevens-Alvord">Kurt Stevens Alvord</a> as the father of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4zcFr9tBi8">Tiffany Alvord and her brothers</a>.
