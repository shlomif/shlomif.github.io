<!DOCTYPE html><section class="h3"><header><h3 id="competent_people_are_geeks">Competent People Are Geeks</h3><a class="back_to_faq" href="../#competent_people_are_geeks">Node Link</a></header><p>As unlikely as it sounds, I think I reached the "right" conclusions at <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/my-real-person-fan-fiction/">my previous attempt</a> while having a somewhat misled deduction chain.</p><p id="geek_def">As of March 2021, it seems most talented, skillful, competent, and attractive individuals of any gender, age and profession, and past experience are increasingly both geeks (= <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/paul-graham.html">"amateurs"</a>; love what they do; not doing it only for money, even though they may be offered a lot) and <a href="../#what_is_hacking">great hackers</a> (= "action heroes"; bending or challenging the "rules", not accepting their fate, being resourceful, thinking outside the box, etc.). or even "hacker monarchs" / "messiahs". As I show, this implies most new quality screenplays and stories are currently and are going to increasingly not only be fanfiction but also crossovers, parodies, and/or real person fiction - usually including recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">"proprietary"</a> (= restricted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved">"All rights reserved"</a>, "copyrighted") franchises and recent (and often living) real people. And they aren't being written in the finicky, hard to get right, and boring <a href="../#hollywood_screenplay_format">Hollywood-blessed screenplay format</a>, and geeks will increasingly stop sending drafts or proposals to <a href="../#be_communicative">non-communicative</a> reviewers.</p><p>One thing I got wrong is thinking a geek will refuse to get paid. Perhaps it was true for amateurs and geeks before the advent of Capitalism, but is no longer true now. That is wrong, as of 2021, because often, geeks are now offered large amounts of money or at least token pay. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, who is a software developer, an action hero, a geek, and <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">a remarkable amateur philosopher and entertainer</a>, is believed to get paid 20 million USD/year. While he will gladly continue to comaintain the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">Linux kernel project</a> for less, it is commonly accepted that it is a reasonable salary to give him.</p><p>Moreover, attractive actors (including female actresses and/or inexperienced and obscure ones and/or formerly big name ones) are also geeky hackers. As a result, they will not play in any badly written film (and usually a dystopian, ending badly, pessimistic, politically correct and dishonest one) even for all the money in the world.</p><p>Geeks are not to be confused with "dorks" who are (for the context of this essay) people without social life, or who seem reckless, not confident, unattractive, etc. Moreover, "amateur" now has pejorative meaning of something done poorly or non-skillfully but in the 19th century, it was a compliment.</p><p>The word "nerd" can mean either "geek" or "dork".</p><p>These were contrasted to "professionalism" (= doing something only for money, regardless of how little or a lot: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJrqpR_7VSo">"We're not just doing it for money!&#8230;We're doing it for a shitload of money"</a>; not enjoying your work).</p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bJrqpR_7VSo" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><p>A geek may agree to do some tasks that are not too enjoyable as part of their job. There is also the old <a href="https://shlomifish.livejournal.com/1747.html">Stoic method</a> of trying not to hate a task and even allowing oneself to enjoy it. This is reflected in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftxnr28LDXc">the "spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down" scene</a> from Disney's <i>Mary Poppins</i>. However, if the job is destructive and pointless, e.g one that stands against the contemporary <a href="../#open_free_share_steal">"open / free / share"</a> ideals, then it can never be enjoyable.</p></section></main>
