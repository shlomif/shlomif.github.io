As I show, this implies most new quality screenplays and stories are currently and are going to increasingly not only be fanfiction but also crossovers, parodies, and/or real person fiction - usually including recent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">"proprietary"</a> (= restricted, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved">"All rights reserved"</a>, "copyrighted") franchises and recent (and often living) real people. And they aren't being written in the finicky, hard to get right, and boring <a href="#hollywood_screenplay_format">Hollywood-blessed screenplay format</a>, and geeks will increasingly stop sending drafts or proposals to <a href="#be_communicative">non-communicative</a> reviewers.</p><p>One thing I got wrong is thinking a geek will refuse to get paid. Perhaps it was true for amateurs and geeks before the advent of Capitalism, but is no longer true now. That is wrong, as of 2021, because often, geeks are now offered large amounts of money or at least token pay. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, who is a software developer, an action hero, a geek, and <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">a remarkable amateur philosopher and entertainer</a>, is believed to get paid 20 million USD/year.

Geeks were considered intelligent, but unattractive, shy, anti-social, unathletic, and often without "real-life" social life. My 2005 <a href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/human-hacking/conclusions/">"The Human Hacking Field Guide"</a> story presented male and female open source and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_content">open/free content</a> geeks and hackers as competent, confident, sexually attractive, socially capable, assertive, as well as popular and coveted.
