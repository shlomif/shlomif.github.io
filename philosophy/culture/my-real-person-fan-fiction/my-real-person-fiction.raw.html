The more I think about it, the more it seems that I think less highly of it, despite the fact that some people told me that it wasn’t a waste of time, and that I’ll fondly look back at my studies. Part of the problem was that I studied there only in order to get my degree (while I’m not interested in electronics), which I wanted in order to get more higher-paying jobs.</p><p>I paid money to study there, and the people whom were indirectly paid by me, while sometimes being helpful, often had limited time to help me, looked down upon me, and gave me hard tests and unfair grades. It destroyed my self-esteem, harmed my health, made me maniacal, put me on psychiatric drugs which <a class="link" href="https://github.com/shlomif/why-openly-bipolar-people-should-not-be-medicated">harmed my health</a> further, and taught me little of lasting value. Despite paying, I didn’t enjoy it, and only did it to get the diploma, so I can get a more lucrative job later on.</p><p>Paying and getting paid made the experience worse. This is the curse of <span class="strong"><strong>professionalism</strong></span>, which used to mean doing something for money instead of because you love it and enjoy it.</p><p>Many years later, I started solving problems at <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler">Project Euler</a>, one of many <a class="link" href="https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/problem-sets-competitive-programming.md">competitive programming sites</a>. Since I had quite a bit of maths and programming background, I did quite well at it, and have solved over 300 problems. I didn’t have to pay, but I voluntarily paid a small donation. I am still unhappy by the somewhat degraded <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience">user experience</a> of it, but am otherwise very content.</p><p>Despite not paying or expecting to be paid, or rather because of it, I was met with gratitude, respect and admiration by the people I helped on the <a class="link" href="https://freenode.net/">freenode chat network</a> with previous problems I solved, or by announcing that I have solved a new one - also without paying.</p><p>I was much happier as an <span class="strong"><strong>amateur</strong></span> - someone who does what they do because they enjoy it and love it, not to get paid. See <a class="link" href="http://paulgraham.com/opensource.html">Paul Graham’s "What business can learn from open source"</a> .</p><p>Lately, by inspiration from a correspondent on an Internet chat who mentioned someone’s one line Résumé, I wrote my <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Software-Dev.html">"I’m a Rock Star software developer" Résumé</a>. I included only amateur achievements there, including Project Euler, and excluded the Technion. At first I thought it was because EE B.Sc. degrees are quite common and so not notable enough. But then I realised something else: I wasn’t proud of my EE degree. These were my most vexing, toxic, soul destroying, unproductive, six years of my life. I regret doing it for greed of money.</p><p>That junkie stand up comedian whom I saw at a captioned twitter video was right: if you want to succeed as a writer, entertainer, and amateur philosopher: don’t work "hard".</p><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="professionalism_in_20thC" class="title">Professionalism</h4></div></div></div><p>Professionalism seemed the way to go throughout a large part of the 20th century.

Its name reminded me of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</a> - a successful and popular singer, who has many videos on YouTube, some of which I am fond of and which many people praise. You probably heard of her. Now, I told him that she probably charges more than 300 USD/hour, but the fact of the matter is, she might perform even for free for something that is important to her, because performing is fun. Her videos, despite often being popular, probably do not offset their production value in YouTube ads. But they are good publicity, provide fodder for remixes, parodies and covers, and are fun enough to produce so she can afford to sustain the cost. She doesn’t work for money or even for a shitload of money. She works for fun.</p><p>There is likely a lot of fan fic, fan art, comments and idolisations of her on the Internet. She may not improve significantly, but she can derive inspiration and comments from them, and even if she is criticised or held in contempt, she can either ignore that criticism or learn from it.</p><p>If I wrote a Real Person Fan-fiction of Taylor Swift, she won’t be harmed or object. If I depicted her figuratively "kicking the ass" of the NSA in <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">Summerschool at the NSA</a>, it would not have harmed her reputation a dent, and it may have even give her good publicity and even fodder for songs or videos.</p><p>As an amateur, it would not have harmed her, and I would not have been considered a villain.</p><p>But I did not.</p></section><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="smg_and_sglau" class="title">Sarah Michelle Gellar and Summer Glau</h3></div></div></div><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="././summernsa-logo-small.webp" alt="Logo of Summerschool at the NSA"/></div></div><p>Instead I sent the actresses <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_Glau">Summer Glau</a>, two actresses who seemed invaluable for that due to previous associations I had. While their acting careers were already on the brink of termination, and I depicted them positively, it likely may have sealed the envelope on both of their Hollywood careers. But it was probably the best for both, because the Hollywood professionals were already intimidated by them, and they could be more productive as non-acting non-professionals activists. Why?</p><p>Because they are professionals. The better they played, the more they were scorned and maligned and given poorer roles by other jealous professional movie makers who were jealous of their competency and elevated perception by amateur fans who knew better. There is a whole <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174571159372935168">YouTube search about why Hollywood cannot cast X any more</a> but it is the same old story.

It happens all the time."</p><p>But in the music industry it never happens. It will be very preposterous to ever see a YouTube feature "Why no one listens to the songs of The Beatles any more.". Moreover, even though <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie</a> was killed (in part due to her own mismanagement), and I was shocked and saddened by that, her songs are still popular.

I have no idea how this demand will be “good for the people”, help make the world a better place, and/or <a class="link" href="https://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html">“help someone get laid”</a>. It just seems like a <a class="link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law">dick move</a> by some overzealous lawyers.</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="././Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day.webp" alt="Talk like a pirate day"/></div></div><p>And now for the other side of the coin, according to the English Wikipedia, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day">International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a> (which is a fun holiday which I celebrate on the Internet, and have also created some <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">related fan art</a>), had become successful in part because its copyrights or trademarks have not been enforced, which led to a "viral" growth.</p><p>It is likely that creators of commercial franchises would benefit more by making their worlds, characters, and concepts unrestricted, rather than being territorial around them. Some of my Internet friends agree with me that <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaceballs">Spaceballs</a> is a better film than the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars_Trilogy">original Star Wars trilogy</a>. However, being a parody and therefore <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/#why_fan_fic">fan art</a>, it builds upon the original work and depends on it.</p><p>We are all <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants"><span class="strong"><strong>standing on the shoulders of giants</strong></span></a>, so why not let others stand on ours?</p></section></section><footer/></body></html>
