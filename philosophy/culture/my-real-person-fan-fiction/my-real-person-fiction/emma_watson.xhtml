And it’s because she too became far too powerful and competent for the incompetent and envious professional film makers and critics. But like great action heroes (or "hackers") of the past like <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#david_and_goliath">David who fought Goliath</a>, its modernisation in the <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YyBtMxZgQs">Indiana Jones gun scene</a>, or the <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Eont_yEGZs">trailer for "Hamlet" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger</a>, she will not accept her fate, and bend and break the rules to carve her unique destiny.</p><p>She will give Hollywood the fat finger and start producing fan screenplays (in any conceivable format - not only the overly strict, and pedantic Hollywood screenplay format, which is hard to get right) that she will sponsor out of her own pocket. They will depict her as the sexy, competent, bad-ass ass-kicker that she and her fans know she is rather than her traditional sheepish and recessive (but not quite) <a class="link" href="https://harrypotter.fandom.com/wiki/Hermione_Granger">Hermione Granger</a> image, and these videos will be available free of charge on YouTube. Many awesome male and female actor hackers who used to be household names but are now unhirable for becoming too competent, honest and intimidating, will follow suit.</p><p>She might opt to make the material available first under relatively restrictive licences such as <a class="link" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">CC-by-nc-sa</a> or even <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved">All rights reserved</a> and ask to collect "ransom" money to make it <a class="link" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC-by</a> or even <a class="link" href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">CC0 / Public Domain</a>. She might give access to large data files and high quality videos for a pay or sell exquisite collectors sets (just like Nine Inch Nails did with <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghosts_I%E2%80%93IV">Ghosts I-IV</a>).</p><p>There are other business models:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="https://github.com/nayafia/lemonade-stand">nayafia/lemonade-stand: A handy guide to financial support for open source</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/web/models-for-commerce/">"Alternative" Profitable Models for Web-based Commerce</a></li></ul></div><p>As inconceivable as it seems, I think a <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminator_%28franchise%29">Terminator</a> parody with Emma Watson as the evil terminator, and Arnold Schwarzenegger trying to protect from her has a great potential. And I already have written crossovers starring her in anything from an <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/Emma-Watson-applying-for-a-software-dev-job/">attack of the software industry’s hiring process</a>; to a <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Harry-Potter.html">crossover</a> of Harry Potter, Sesame Street and other sources of inspiration ; as well as naturally <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/cast.html"><span class="emphasis"><em>Selina Mandrake</em></span></a> which is a self-concious parody of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer"><span class="emphasis"><em>Buffy</em></span></a>, mashed up with Judaism and Israelism, as well as <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine">Star Trek DS9</a>, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29">The Princess Bride</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers">The Three Musketeers</a>.</p><p>Hollywood will soon be terminated as an inefficient and lazy oligopoly with relatively few remaining active franchises, few remaining able and competent actors who quickly will follow suit, and a flood of indistinguishable high budget comic books movies with incompetent and unattractive actors who didn’t have the sense and competence to become YouTubers, empty cinemas, and boring "original" films. Either that or it too will convert to the amateur and <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/">"open"</a> models, which like the signed artists labels of the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recording_Industry_Association_of_America">RIAA</a> mostly get out of the way (minus some censoring of YouTube content, both "copyright-violating" and legitimate, which I hope and plan will stop soon).</p><p>If Taylor Swift was able to <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcIy9NiNbmo">depict</a> her female friends and herself as bad-ass modern day female warriors, and still continue to outsell her shows, so should <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Emma-Watson/">Emma Watson</a>, or <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar">Gellar</a>, or <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/">Summer Glau</a>, or <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Megan_Fox">Megan Fox</a>, or <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/">Jennifer Lawrence</a>, or <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris</a>, or <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Cruise">Tom Cruise</a>, or countless other awesome hackers who would prosper more as amateurs, rather than in the increasingly money-hungry, soul-sucking, and mind destroying, professional Hollywood.</p><p>Hasta la vista baby!
