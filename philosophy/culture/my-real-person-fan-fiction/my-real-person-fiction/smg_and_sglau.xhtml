While their acting careers were already on the brink of termination, and I depicted them positively, it likely may have sealed the envelope on both of their Hollywood careers. But it was probably the best for both, because the Hollywood professionals were already intimidated by them, and they could be more productive as non-acting non-professionals activists. Why?</p><p>Because they are professionals. The better they played, the more they were scorned and maligned and given poorer roles by other jealous professional movie makers who were jealous of their competency and elevated perception by amateur fans who knew better. There is a whole <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1174571159372935168">YouTube search about why Hollywood cannot cast X any more</a> but it is the same old story. To paraphrase on an old <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series">Star Trek (the original series)</a> quote: "It does not happen some of the time. It happens all the time."</p><p>But in the music industry it never happens. It will be very preposterous to ever see a YouTube feature "Why no one listens to the songs of The Beatles any more.". Moreover, even though <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christina_Grimmie">Christina Grimmie</a> was killed (in part due to her own mismanagement), and I was shocked and saddened by that, her songs are still popular. If I now rewrote my screenplay depicting her as a super intelligent and resourceful female, who kicks the ass of the NSA, people will think I am helping keep her legacy alive, and revere me for it.</p></section><footer><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table style="width:100%"><tr><td style="width:40%;text-align:left"><a accesskey="p" href="taylor_swift.xhtml">Prev</a> </td><td style="width:20%;text-align:center"> </td><td style="width:40%;text-align:right"> <a accesskey="n" href="jk_rowling.xhtml">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td style="width:40%;text-align:left;vertical-align:top">Taylor Swift as an amateur </td><td style="width:20%;text-align:center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.xhtml">Home</a></td><td style="width:40%;text-align:right;vertical-align:top"> JK Rowling vs. Me</td></tr></table></div></footer></body></html>
