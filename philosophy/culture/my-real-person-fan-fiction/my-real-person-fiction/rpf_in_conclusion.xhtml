It continued to be practised throughout history, with relatively few moral obstacles until in the 20th century, fan fiction and RPF started being held in contempt due to copyright maximalism.</p><p>I now realise that fan fiction and especially real person fiction can also be used to help combat the flood of new characters and names that plagues many more "original" stories.
