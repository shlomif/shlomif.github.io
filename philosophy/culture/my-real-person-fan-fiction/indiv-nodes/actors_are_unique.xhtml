Similarly I am more and more convinced that only Emma Watson can play Selina on <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/">my <span class="emphasis"><em>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</em></span></a> screenplay but I&#8217;d like her to do it because she enjoys it and work for relatively little. It will be preposterous to assume that the late Christina Grimmie can ever be replaced by her YouTuber colleague <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiffany_Alvord">Tiffany Alvord</a> or even by Taylor Swift, despite the fact that all three were or are wonderful singers.</p><p>Actors should become amateurs and work for fun on amateur films they like by amateur writers, who like me, write mostly fanfic and often crossovers and even real person fiction. As much as I like <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kermit_the_Frog">Kermit the Frog</a> and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucky_Luke">Lucky Luke</a>, I wish Chuck Norris and Summer Glau to <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Muppets-Show-TNI/Summer-Glau-and-Chuck-Norris.html">star along them</a>, because the latter two are equally as awesome even if real. Just like the old show <a class="link" href="https://muppet.fandom.com/wiki/The_Muppet_Show"><span class="emphasis"><em>The Muppet Show</em></span></a> featured celebrity guest stars as themselves, and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street"><span class="emphasis"><em>Sesame Street</em></span></a> has been doing it since its inception in 1969.</p><p>In Ancient times, most philosophers were entertainers who collected donation money after their performances, and in fact were closer to today&#8217;s entertainers than our contemporary ivory tower professional philosophers. See:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBIxGjSHzF8">Mel Brooks&#8217; Stand up philosopher</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/peter_ustinov_161259">Peter Ustinov: "If Botticelli were alive today he&#8217;d be working for Vogue"</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#if_ayn_rand_was_born_in_the_1990s">"If Ayn Rand was born in the 1990s she would be Christina Grimmie"</a></li><li class="listitem"><a class="link" href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=4229">ESR&#8217;s post about why most classical music is a bunch of museum pieces</a></li></ul></div><p>Chuck Norris and Bruce Lee are the last in the line of master professional warriors (believed to have passed through <a class="link" href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</a> himself - one of the greatest and most underrated <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacking-heroism">hackers</a> of all time). However, I believe that some of the newer amateur <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed_martial_arts">Mixed Martial Arts (MMA)</a> fighters could have <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-english-play-to-lose">defeated even Bruce Lee</a>.</p><p>The better the former professional actors like Emma Watson, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Summer Glau, and Chuck Norris had become the more they were resented, hated, envied and mistreated. Until it hit their breaking point and they got angry and burst in rage against their mistreatment. Simply because they were professionals and worked for as much money as possible.</p><p>It is possible that the reason why it seems like the <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Chuck-Norris/">Chuck Norris Facts</a> have made <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#Chuck_Norris">a comeback</a> recently, is because Norris has decided to play in roles he liked, even if he got paid little or not at all, or was paid after the fact. He became a happy and respected amateur. I won&#8217;t be surprised if he sometimes agrees to star in local school plays, or otherwise star in roles that may seem almost completely unlike his traditional Hollywood image.</p><p>But for now I&#8217;ll write my real person fic on singers and YouTubers. I already have one more factoid about Taylor Swift and there likely will be more. I assure you that for a long time you won&#8217;t see a YouTube video "Why people won&#8217;t listen to Taylor Swift&#8217;s songs any more?". Poor Taylor! I&#8217;m sure she won&#8217;t survive reading this new Taylor Swift Factoid, and sue me immediately. (That was irony.)</p></section></main>
