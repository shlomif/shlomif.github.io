<title>The origins of consciousness and madness</title>
<simpara>It is well known that when individuals of most <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primate">primate</link> species (including
monkeys!) are separated from their group/tribe, they stop eating and drinking
and become unenergetic and can even die out of thirst or hunger. This
is a very similar phenomenon to
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder</link> in humans.</simpara>
<simpara>In order to avoid it, humans, who often needed to travel long distances alone to
find mates, food, water, elementary materials, etc.  developed during their
evolution a thought process, where they hallucinated guiding thoughts (or even
voices) of "leaders" (= "guideline-generators") which
emitted "rules", or even just "guidelines" to entertain them, guide them,
encourage them, amuse them etc. But these humans were nevertheless nonsentient.</simpara>
<simpara>These leaders could be all kind of entities: friends, relatives, pets,
inanimate objects, dead people, abstract concepts (e.g: "love", "clumsiness"),
mythological figures (including polytheistic gods such as
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeus</link> or <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asherah</link> ,
but
also non-divine mortals such as <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh</link> or
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solomon</link> or <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesop</link> )
, as well as <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_idealism">platonic ideals</link>
and subideals such as "the human", "the child", "the tree", "the oak", "the bird",
"the swallow", etc.</simpara>
<simpara>Note that these language-speaking humans, didn’t immediately obey these leaders
and guidelines, as people who have read about <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumer">Sumerian history</link> can attest to, but
they still used it for reasoning.</simpara>
<simpara>From 2000 BC to 1000 BC the <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akkadian_language">Akkadians</link>
and their extant colonies of <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylon">Babylon</link>
and <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyria">Assyria</link> developed increasingly
simplified methods of writing, culminating in the Phoenician
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abjad">Abjad</link>
(or vowel-less "Alphabet"),
which was particularly suitable for writing <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaanite_languages">Canaanite</link>
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aramaic">Aramaic</link> and other languages which
we now call <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semitic_languages">Semitic languages</link> (albeit
the use of "Shem" to describe peoples in the Tanakh and
elsewhere was <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/humanity/ongoing-text.html#the-gate">more political</link>
)</simpara>
<simpara>As the Alphabet was easy enough to be learnt even by children (and often was)
and there were plenty of clay tablets or stone walls to write using chalk or
other stones (as I can attest from my experiences in hiking .il and .pa ), many
guidelines were exchanged there in the form of messages (or "memes") not unlike
the Internet
<link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/DocBook5/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/departing_pope_about_twitter.xhtml">social media</link>
in today’s world.</simpara>
<simpara>These guidelines were referred to as "el"s (אל) in Hebrew which stems from the
"towards" preposition,
so it meant "direction", "target", "destination" and only meant "a god" later.</simpara>
<simpara>A "guideline-generator" was called "eloha" (אלוה) which meant a collection of "el"s,
and whose plural, "elohim" ("אלוהים") now means <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God">the monotheisic "God"</link>
in modern Hebrew. (This is similar to how the modern English word "corporation"
stems from "corpora" which is a Latin plural of "corpus": "body", "person".)</simpara>
<simpara>Jaynes notes that the modern Hebrew word for king <link xl:href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D7%9E%D7%9C%D7%9A#Hebrew">"melekh" (מלך)</link> meant a lesser leader than an "El", and in butchered ancient Hebrew could have meant "go from where!" ("me’ayin lekh") or "reason" or "cause" or "incentive".</simpara>
<simpara>One of these guideline generators was "אנוכי יהוה אלהיך" (= "anochi yehovah eloheichah" in modern
Hebrew) which
meant "<emphasis>he/she/what is and will be</emphasis> shall be your guideline-generator" (which likely
emitted guidelines close to "live in the present and for the future" or "let bygones
be bygones" or even "forget it", "I forgive you",
<link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHbRYNriVAA">"Let it be"</link>,
<link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXqWVWHW8dA">"Let it go"</link>,
<link xl:href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbY_aP-alkw">"no worries"/"hakuna matata"</link>).
This is now known as the
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_am_the_Lord_thy_God">First commandment</link> although
"Dibber" in Hebrew simply means "he/she/what/it spoke".</simpara>
<simpara>We can imagine a conversation then to go similar to this:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>Adam: <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ares">Ares</link> told me to kill you</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Bob: but <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athena">Athena</link> forbade killing innocent people</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Adam: The god of Justice tells me you are right, I hope you can forgive me</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>Bob: "Jehovah" tells me to forgive you.</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>While being useful (see <link xl:href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">Saladin</link>
for instance), it was often overridden by other leaders or their guidelines.
As a result, the following meta-guideline or followup for the 1st commandment was
appended to it:
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten_Commandments">The second commandment</link>:
"No other leaders [or guidelines] shall take precedence over me [= The Jehovah Guideline]".
("לא יהיה לך אלהים אחרים על פניי")</simpara>
<simpara>This was nice and well, until one day one boy, girl, man, or woman, who likely
was taught to read (possibly by himself) - I’ll call him SoulZero -
accidentally read the Second Commandment <emphasis role="strong">before</emphasis> he was familiar with the
first.  Then he interpreted it as: "The ‘Soul’ Leader said: no other leader or
its guideline shall take precedence over me [= the ‘Soul' Leader!]"</simpara>
<simpara>So it was self-referential as suspected in
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach">"Gödel, Escher, Bach"</link> and threw
SoulZero’s brain into a short confusion and demoting of the leaders and their
guidelines from which there was only one escape: the birth of a human soul aka
"ego" or "I-ness" or "center of sentience/consciousness". A personal meta-leader.</simpara>

<simpara>SoulZero started hearing mere thoughts instead of voices that sounded real. He
became a <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Star-Trek/We-the-Living-Dead/ongoing-text.html#terran-vampires—​meet—​moses-tells-his-story">"self-leader"</link>
or "Ben-elohim" or <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tukulti-Ninurta_I">"king-of-kings"</link>.</simpara>
<simpara>The "worst" thing was that it was contagious and soon many people became
sentient. Moses and the other self-leaders told their gospel in the form of
"There are no gods? What are you talking about? Hear this: No other leader
shall take precedence over me".</simpara>
<simpara>The self-leaders could better lead their life but on the downside had
to <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-all-cards-on-the-table-2013/#dont_just_go_with_the_flow">decide to think</link>
and they could be happy, "down", clinically depressed, mildly
depressed, hypomanic, manic or even Schizophrenic.</simpara>

<section xml:id="MDD">
<title>Clinical depression ( MDD ) and Murder</title>
<simpara>From experience, while I was in
<link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">Major depressive disorder ( MDD )</link>,
my mind was void of thoughts and I was constantly seeking
guidance. Moreover, I believed that the advice and the guidance were
absolute "rules" or even dogma, and that I must obey it.</simpara>
<simpara>In <link xl:href="https://www.shlomifish.org/meta/FAQ/crime_and_punishment.xhtml">Crime and Punishment</link>,
Raskolnikov is described as MDDed and as murdering innocent people.</simpara>

<section xml:id="neviim">
<title>The nevi’im and amateur philosophers:</title>
<simpara>I believe that "niba" / "hitnabé" meant "to be crazy"/"to emit crazy things"
in ancient Hebrew: <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevi%27im">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nevi%27im</link> - including
in today’s casual sense or "to seek divine guidance". Initially,
most of them were out-of-control <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schizophrenia">Schizophrenics</link>
and <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania">maniacs</link> but eventually many
of the best Nevi’im were <link xl:href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanic</link>
at worst, and not only emulated their predecessors or contemporaries
but topped them.</simpara>
<simpara>They could have been funny, or exalting, or sexy, or blasphemous.
They often spoke in normal prose or free-form verse.</simpara>
<simpara>Ezekiel chapter no. I - <link xl:href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16099">https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16099</link> -
can be seen as mocking the various previous visions-of-revelations and
doing it so well that people found it incredibly funny (and it is pointless
to derive meaning from it - Ezekiel was just "making shit up").</simpara>
