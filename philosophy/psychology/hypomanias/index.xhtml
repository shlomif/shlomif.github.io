Did you find it difficult to perform many tasks that you could do normally, found it hard to concentrate, was flooded with bad thoughts, and had problems going to sleep? If so, you may have been <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinically depressed</a>, or clinically anxious. In addition, people who suffer from <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Mania-Depressia also known as &#8220;Bipolar disorder&#8221;</a> (like me) also tend to get into opposite states called <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanias</a> or Manias. While &#8220;hypomania&#8221; contains the word &#8220;mania&#8221;, they are actually below-mania, and the person is still in control to some extent, and, with some awareness, may realise they are in a bad mental condition.</p><p>Clinical depressions are not everyday &#8220;I am depressed.&#8221; or &#8220;being down&#8221; depressions, but rather a feeling that one is bad, and being consumed with guilt, with a tendency of being less communicative and less able to perform one&#8217;s responsibilities.</p><p>I probably have <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Mania-Depressia</a> (or &#8220;Bipolar disorder&#8221;) because I had a single &#8220;Great Mania&#8221; and a few shorter manias, because I have frequent Hypomanias, and because I had some periods of clinical depressions and clinical anxieties. So I&#8217;m writing about this from experience.</p><p>One should note that one swallow does not make a spring. Some people had a few clinical depressions at certain points, and have since led happy, normal lives. An example for this are <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression">Postpartum depressions</a> which happen to some women after giving birth to a child, but there are other cases.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="symptoms" class="title">Symptoms</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/symptoms.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="symptoms-of-depression" class="title">Symptoms of Depression</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/symptoms-of-depression.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>Quoting from <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_depression">the Wikipedia</a>, the symptoms of depression are:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Persistent sad, anxious or &#8220;empty&#8221; mood</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Loss of appetite and/or weight loss or conversely overeating and weight gain</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Insomnia, early morning awakening, or oversleeping</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Restlessness or irritability</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Psychomotor agitation or psychomotor retardation</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Feelings of worthlessness, inappropriate guilt, helplessness</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Feelings of hopelessness, pessimism</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Difficulty thinking, concentrating, remembering or making decisions</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Thoughts of [[death]] or suicide or attempts at suicide</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Loss of interest or pleasure in hobbies and activities that were once enjoyed</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Withdrawal from social situations, family and friends</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Decreased energy, fatigue, feeling &#8220;slowed down&#8221; or sluggish</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Persistent physical symptoms that do not respond to treatment, such as headaches, digestive problems, and chronic pain</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Decrease/Feeling in motor-speed (time seems to slow down)</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><p>These are mostly the external symptoms.

He then goes on to explain that your feelings are affected by the thoughts that go through your head, and that by challenging your irrational thoughts, you can improve your mood.</p><p>He then lists 10 cognitive errors that people make which may make people depressed. Among these errors are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Should statements</strong></span> - you try to motivate yourself by saying things like &#8220;I should be more careful&#8221;, or &#8220;I should not have talked to him like that.&#8221; or &#8220;I ought to be more considerate&#8221;. What these should statements do is actually demotivate, and make you feel down.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Disqualifying the positive</strong></span> - an example for this is that when you receive a compliment, you say something like &#8220;they didn&#8217;t mean it.&#8221;, or &#8220;it doesn&#8217;t count.&#8221;, or &#8220;he doesn&#8217;t know the real me.&#8221;</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Mental filter</strong></span> - here you focus on one negative detail (a &#8220;fly in the ointment&#8221;), while ignoring the rest of the picture.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>All or nothing thinking</strong></span> - you want everything to be perfect. For example, you&#8217;ll accept no grade below 90% or so (even if it&#8217;s a passing grade), or so.</p></li></ol></div><p>Dr. Burns then gives a simple recipe to gain self-esteem: one writes down an automatic thought that disturbs him (or her), and then the feelings that he feels (with percentages). Afterwards, he should write which cognitive errors he has made followed by a rational response to the feelings, and after that the new feelings.</p><p>Burns then discusses several useful techniques for anger management, and for dealing with criticism.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Approval Addiction.</strong></span> - you want to be approved by other people and fear disapproval for them.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Productivity Addiction</strong></span> - you care about your work, how productive you are, how much you achieve, etc. (Much more common among men.)</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Love addiction</strong></span> - you want to be loved a lot.

All of this is non-sense, because I clearly recall feeling miserable when being depressed or clinically anxious and after gaining some awareness, was able to tell that my hypomanias were not desirable either. It&#8217;s not a belief that people have conditioned me to believe - it&#8217;s one that I developed myself.</p><p>I can rant much more about Post-modernist relativism, that some of proponents of it claimed people with disabilities such as deafness or blindness, who can be treated to some extent, should not be, because deafness or blindness were just different ways of perception, and not actual disabilities. But the point is that while you may experience depression or hypomania, it is neither desirable nor inevitable, and that you can overcome it.</p><p id="emotions-are-not-our-master">During my normal state, I had, like other people, experienced many positive and negative emotions: joy, anger, frustration, fear, boredom, a feeling of disorientation, love, exhilaration, attraction, disappointment, hatred, remorse, sadness, etc. This is perfectly normal and these emotions have a purpose, and I was otherwise happy when I experienced them.

After he does that, he discovers that he is no longer Captain and that he have lacked the self-motivation that was needed in order to become the hero that he used to be. As a result, he says that &#8220;I would rather die as the man I was, than live the life I just saw.&#8221;</p><p>Or consider <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Keller">Helen Keller</a>, who was born deaf-blind. If she had been born normal, she would most likely have led a happy life. On the other hand, without her disability, she might not had become the superwoman that she did, because there would have been nothing to motivate her.</p><p>Would I rather lead a normal life? Yes, I would. But, on the other hand, I recognise that getting into hypomanias is part of who I am, and probably the price I have to pay for being so creative. While I would like to reduce its effect, I thank God (so to speak) for allowing me to be able to write so many articles and essays, compose so many stories, and being a capable programmer.</p><p>So I guess the curse and the blessing are part of what makes me who I am.</p><p>Nevertheless, as I noted earlier, it is probably possible to combat the harmful effects of Bipolarity or Unipolarity as much as possible using Cognitive-Behavioural Therapy and other means, and I intend to work on that. It is my hope that you are now wiser on how to better deal with such harmful psychological moods, in case you have been suffering from them.</p><p>Feel good!</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="doc_info" class="title">Document Information</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/doc_info.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="about_the_author" class="title">About the Author</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/about_the_author.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>My name is Shlomi Fish and I am an Israeli software developer, essayist and writer.
