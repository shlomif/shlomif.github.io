achievements did not count and were bad? Did you find it difficult to perform many tasks that you could do normally, found it hard to concentrate, was flooded with bad thoughts, and had problems going to sleep? If so, you may have been <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">clinically depressed</a>, or clinically anxious. In addition, people who suffer from <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Mania-Depressia also known as “Bipolar disorder”</a> (like me) also tend to get into opposite states called <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">hypomanias</a> or Manias. While “hypomania” contains the word “mania”, they are actually below-mania, and the person is still in control to some extent, and, with some awareness, may realise they are in a bad mental condition.</p><p>Clinical depressions are not everyday “I am depressed.” or “being down” depressions, but rather a feeling that one is bad, and being consumed with guilt, with a tendency of being less communicative and less able to perform one’s responsibilities.</p><p>I probably have <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Mania-Depressia</a> (or “Bipolar disorder”) because I had a single “Great Mania” and a few shorter manias, because I have frequent Hypomanias, and because I had some periods of clinical depressions and clinical anxieties. So I’m writing about this from experience.</p><p>One should note that one swallow does not make a spring. Some people had a few clinical depressions at certain points, and have since led happy, normal lives. An example for this are <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postpartum_depression">Postpartum depressions</a> which happen to some women after giving birth to a child, but there are other cases.</p></section></section><footer><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table style="width:100%"><tr><td style="width:40%;text-align:left"> </td><td style="width:20%;text-align:center"> </td><td style="width:40%;text-align:right"> <a accesskey="n" href="symptoms.xhtml">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td style="width:40%;text-align:left;vertical-align:top"> </td><td style="width:20%;text-align:center"> </td><td style="width:40%;text-align:right;vertical-align:top"> Symptoms</td></tr></table></div></footer></body></html>
