<section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="philosophy" class="title">Philosophy</h4><h:a class="back_to_faq" href="../#philosophy">Node Link</h:a></header><p>It is my impression that often the philosophies and idea systems that we are generally exposed to (e.g: most western religions), are very harmful for one&#8217;s self-esteem and prevent one from properly getting out of depressions.</p><p>An example for this is what the New Testament says in the Sermon of the Mount: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">But I say unto you, that whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his heart.</span>&#8221;</span>. As I explained before, people have no control over their immediate emotions and should not feel guilty for possessing ones that they may consider bad. While most Christians I&#8217;ve talked to about that, did not think that what that means is that lust was as morally condemnable as rape is, this has been traditionally interpreted as such, and is how I interpret the meaning of the this verse. And naturally, this is just a small example.</p><p>Therefore, I suggest you instead study and adopt a more benevolent psychological philosophy, which will help give you enough tools to live your life more happily and to deal with clinical conditions as they arise. My personal favourite is <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/guide-to-neo-tech/">Neo-Tech</a>, which is an extension and re-organisation of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)">Ayn Rand&#8217;s Objectivism</a>, with many vital corrections. However, I do not rule out the premise that different personal philosophies will be better for different people.</p></section></main>
