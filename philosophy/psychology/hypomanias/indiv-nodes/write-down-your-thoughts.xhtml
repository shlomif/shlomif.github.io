I would be a good idea not to publicise them in public until you&#8217;re well out of a hypomania, because they may prove to be immature or silly in the short-run.</p><p>I personally may have sometimes been rejected from jobs because of the many things I&#8217;ve written and placed online, and which are easily accessible using a Google Search. I don&#8217;t mind that because I feel that expressing and publicising my creativity is more important than making myself a better job candidate to some &#8220;attractive&#8221; jobs. And some employers seemed to be very impressed by some of what I wrote online, or at least did not mind that, and these seem like jobs I prefer.</p><p>It is naturally a good idea to receive as much commentary as possible about one&#8217;s articles or writings in private before publicising them for all the Internet to see.</p></section></main>
