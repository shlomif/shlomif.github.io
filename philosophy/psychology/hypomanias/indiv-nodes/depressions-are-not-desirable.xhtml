All of this is non-sense, because I clearly recall feeling miserable when being depressed or clinically anxious and after gaining some awareness, was able to tell that my hypomanias were not desirable either. It&#8217;s not a belief that people have conditioned me to believe - it&#8217;s one that I developed myself.</p><p>I can rant much more about Post-modernist relativism, that some of proponents of it claimed people with disabilities such as deafness or blindness, who can be treated to some extent, should not be, because deafness or blindness were just different ways of perception, and not actual disabilities. But the point is that while you may experience depression or hypomania, it is neither desirable nor inevitable, and that you can overcome it.</p><p id="emotions-are-not-our-master">During my normal state, I had, like other people, experienced many positive and negative emotions: joy, anger, frustration, fear, boredom, a feeling of disorientation, love, exhilaration, attraction, disappointment, hatred, remorse, sadness, etc. This is perfectly normal and these emotions have a purpose, and I was otherwise happy when I experienced them. But they are more natural than depression, which is much longer, and is mentally and physically unhealthy. <a href="../#ftn.emotions-are-not-our-master" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[Emotions]</sup></a></p><p>That put aside, you shouldn&#8217;t feel bad about being depressed when you do. It&#8217;s perfectly OK to feel it, and being consumed with guilt about being depressed will only make it worse. You should accept the fact that you&#8217;re feeling bad or being under-productive and realise that this feeling will pass.</p></section></main>
