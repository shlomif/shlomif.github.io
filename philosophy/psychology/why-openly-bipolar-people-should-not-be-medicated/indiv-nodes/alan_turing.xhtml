Here in Israel, openly gay, bisexual and lesbian individuals are subject to the same rights and responsibilities as straight individuals, and while a few issues are still a matter of unresolved debate, a gay person can lead a fully normal and healthy life, without being sedated and medicated.</p><p>But it&#8217;s not all roses.</p></section></main>
