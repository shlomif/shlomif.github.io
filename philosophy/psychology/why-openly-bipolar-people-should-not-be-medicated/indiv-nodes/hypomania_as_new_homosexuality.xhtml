This is documented on my <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/">homesite</a> and other online social media writing.</p><p>Now here is a revelation:</p><pre class="literallayout">post-WWII :: Turing :: homosexuality &lt;=&gt; 2019 :: Me (= Shlomi Fish) :: Hypomanias</pre><p>And I have been medicated and sedated with harmful drugs and now hospitalised in a psychiatric ward, where my access to the outside world is an interconnected Windows 7 computer full of malware, instead of the better managed <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_linux">GNU/Linux desktop</a> boxes I can use at home, along with all my online accounts, which I&#8217;d rather not access here (for security reasons).</p><p>A committee of several experts has made me stay in the ward for several two week segments, trying to rehabiltate me, while I would be happier and receive better therapy in my room at home. I missed <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosh_Hashanah">Rosh Hashanah</a> and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Talk_Like_a_Pirate_Day">International Talk Like a Pirate Day</a> - two of my favourite holidays and I am about to miss <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur">Yom Kippur</a> and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sukkot">Sukkot</a>, which sports the <a class="link" href="http://2019.iconfestival.org.il/">ICon Festival</a> which I find very inspiring.</p><p>Someone asked me if I feel I am comparable to Turing. Well, according to <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/me/resumes/Shlomi-Fish-Resume-as-Writer-Entertainer.html">my R&#233;sum&#233; as a writer and entertainer</a> I am even comparable to such historical great people as <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall">Larry Wall</a> (who is also quite obscure), <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_Street">Sesame Street</a> , <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a> , <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Beatles">The Beatles</a> , and other <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">hacker monarchs</a>.</p><p>Right now I am playing the old <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#fox-in-the-hens-coop">"fox-in-the-hens&#8217;-coop"</a> motif like <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_%28Genesis%29">the biblical Joseph</a> in prison, or Summer Glau in <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">Summerschool at the NSA</a> , in which case what happens when you put a <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#great-hackers">Great Hacker/Action Hero</a> in a secluded place with many minor hackers, and several lazy "I just work here" people who do their job in the worst possible manner, is not a crashed great hacker, but instead many happy hackers workers who are happy to provide their customers with royalty service, even if they are not paid a lot to do it, and many hacker or great hacker inmates.</p></section></main>
