Here in Israel, openly gay, bisexual and lesbian individuals are subject to the same rights and responsibilities as straight individuals, and while a few issues are still a matter of unresolved debate, a gay person can lead a fully normal and healthy life, without being sedated and medicated.</p><p>But it’s not all roses.</p></section><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="hypomania_as_new_homosexuality" class="title">Hypomania and MDD as the new Homosexuality:</h3></div></div></div><p>I have had <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">Major depressive disorders</a> and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypomania">Hypomanias</a> and even one major <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mania">Mania</a> and several shorter manias.

I realised that she became a <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#hacker-monarchs">Hacker Monarch</a> - one of several by the time I and other <a class="link" href="https://freenode.net">freenode</a>ers <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=sharp-gnu—​think-big">joked</a> about her suing Apple Inc. for using the "Swift" trademark for <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_%40programming_language%41">Apple Swift</a>.</p><p>Now here is a revelation: based on the <a class="link" href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=lyrics+taylor+swift+shake+it+off">lyrics</a> to Swift’s <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nfWlot6h_JM">hit song "Shake It Off"</a>: "I stay up too late" , "got nothing on my brain" it seems that she is often hypomanic but instead of battling it, she enjoys it as she is more creative, more energetic, more insightful and more socialable and interesting.</p></section><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="hypomania_is_ok" class="title">Hypomania is OK</h3></div></div></div><p>Hypomania has been believed to be treatable with medication, just like homosexuality in Turing’s time, but I pretty much know the medication only causes many harmful side-effects, and in my case increasingly deprives me of physical energy. My parents thought that using these drugs allowed me to graduate from a B.Sc. in <a class="link" href="https://github.com/shlomif/my-real-person-fan-fiction#the-technion-vs-project-euler">EE in the Technion</a>. Hoerver, not only did they not help, but I now know that these were the 6 and a half most soul destroying, unproductive, useless, and uninspiring years of my life.</p><p>That was because the only reason I continued to learn there was because I wanted to get the diploma so I’ll get more lucrative, higher paying, jobs. If I studied in the Technion or elsewhere, because it was fun, and to expand my horizons, or become a more effective writer / software developer / <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=paul-graham-what-ameteur-meant">amateur</a> philosopher / entertainer , then it would be less of a torture.</p><p>In this day and age people can learn enough about all that by starting from <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/">my homesite - www.shlomifish.org</a> and following the text of the essays, stories and screenplays, and links. While it took me a long time to hone my skills to my level, I wish future people who wish to try to emulate me, to have an easier time. I may be a badass writer and entertainer, but given that I know I should <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/NSA/">"Publish or Perish"</a> and love to share my wisdom and knowledge anyway, and wish people to learn from my mistakes and my successes.</p><p>Most of my screenplays, stories, bits, factoids, <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ShlomiFish">the few videos I have on YouTube</a> (which are very lame compared to the videos of Taylor Swift, but they are a start), <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/shlomif">my tweets</a> etc. were inspired by thoughts I had during hypomanias, and I quite enjoy it.</p><p>Sometimes I get into periods of mild <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder">depressions</a> during which I like to code a lot and to chat less passionately and philosophically on IRC. Or I get into "deep work mode" when I write or <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring">refactor</a> / transition a lot of code or churn a large amount of text. These are also ok.</p><p>Taylor Swift should not be worried from being medicated for being Bipolar. She may do "strange" things such as:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Paying for anything she orders from a meal down to a soft drink, a glass of juice, or even some water, with a 50 USD bill telling the vendor/waiter to keep the change or donate it to charity (or give it to her, only to witness her leaving it on one of the tables for whoever wishes to take it).</li><li class="listitem">Walk alone in the neighbourhood thinking.</li><li class="listitem">Staying up at night chatting in social media chat rooms (e.g. <a class="link" href="https://freenode.net">Freenode</a>, <a class="link" href="https://discordapp.com">Discord</a>, <a class="link" href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a>, and <a class="link" href="https://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/How_Alternatives_Proliferate/">many others</a>), while ordering food or drinks from time to time.</li><li class="listitem">Engage in conversations with complete strangers, to whom she will even gladly <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1175578541292957696">give money</a>.</li><li class="listitem">Eat various foods based upon a whim.

As a result, I snapped out of the mania.</p><p>Afterwards, I have been treated with harmful drugs that had many side effects, and did not prevent future hypomanias or other mood swings. Furthermore, my hypomanias were incredibly productive for me resulting in stuff I placed on <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/">my homesite</a> - and on other social media sites, and which many similar minded hackers (both male and female) enjoyed, complimented me for it, thought they were funny, or alternatively thought they were <a class="link" href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">blasphemous (which indicates they were true)</a>.</p><p>But the people who wanted me to be "mentally healthy" told me these things were irrational, wrong, "schema-driven" and that they were nonsense and that I should not give them weight.</p><p>They were wrong! They were insightful, fresh, and endured their time.</p><p>Now, while I have suffered from many harmful antipsychotics - <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/shc_mo/status/1180165973556506626">it may still be fixed</a> but what if instead of these harmful legal drugs, I would have been treated with good therapy, possibly <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_behavioral_therapy">Cognitive behavioral therapy</a> or more preferably <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/#benevolent-psychological-warfare">Saladin-style benevolent therapy</a>.</p><p>How many potential Taylor Swifts were forced to be a "Shlomi Fish" like me, who despite all was very productive and insightful, or were just hospitalised and sedated and fought against by mediocre minds, who think conformism is mental health, while <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/putting-cards-on-the-table-2019-2020/">it is the opposite</a>. Furthermore, conformism leads to Nazi-style <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">"Superior orders" / The "Nuremberg defense"</a>, including the "I just work here" <a class="link" href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2004/12/06/news-45/">small minded attitude</a> which leads to sadism and vandalism and loss of lives and property that took a lot of effort to construct by hard working, enthusiastic individuals.</p><p>So I say: "do what you want, not what you feel you must. The choice is in your hands. Whatever you do, I’ll accept that." These words go back at least to <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moses">Moses</a>, were <a class="link" href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Saladin_Style/">exemplified by Saladin</a> and were extended and conveyed by greater and greater "memes" including <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T7HiMv5jygk">Taylor Swift’s "Shake it Off" song</a> and the somewhat more established <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2RZXeQc5HU">"Highway to Hell" song by AC/DC</a> (these are both links to two of my favourite covers of them).</p><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="_a_million_psychiatrists_can_be_wrong" class="title">A Million Psychiatrists can be wrong</h4></div></div></div><p>Some people think that a million psychiatrists (and the mass media) cannot be wrong, but they can.
