That is the "fox in a chickens' coop" motif as exemplified in <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(Genesis)">the story of Joseph in prison in the Bible</a>, and that of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de Winter in "The Three Musketeers"</a>, and in the film <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_DeMarco">"Don Juan DeMarco"</a> .

It worked surprisingly well, and I've used the collected wisdom of Moses&#8594;Saladin&#8594;Ayn Rand&#8594;the Beatles&#8594;Sesame Street&#8594;web 2.0 blogs and sites&#8594;My Little Pony / Taylor Swift and my own intuition and trial and error.</p><p>It took me about 6-to-8 weeks, and I suffered from the conditions of the hospital, but otherwise was able to hone my skills in benevolent psychological warfare, and also started writing some essays with my limited computing resources there.</p></section><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr class="footnote-hr"/><div id="ftn.beauty_and_the_geek" class="footnote"><p><a href="../#beauty_and_the_geek" class="para"><sup class="para">[beauty-and-the-geek] </sup></a>It is wrong to <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour.html#pbride_philosophers">look down on reality show contestants</a> (and more recently - YouTubers) who, like older forms of entertainers / philosophers, are seeking recognition and fame.
