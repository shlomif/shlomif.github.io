Prices, production and distribution of goods are determined by a free market.</p><p>&#8230;</p><p>But most writers and commentators put dishonest altruistic-platonistic connotations on the meaning of capitalism: A system of exploitation of the weak by the strong -- devoid of love and good will. A system in which unwanted goods and services are pushed onto consumers through clever, deceptive advertising for the sole purpose of profits and greed. Capitalism dominates most Western governments. Capitalism, big business, and fascism are synonymous.</p></blockquote></div><p>I am no longer a libertarian purist, but I still think Capitalism and liberalism are the best economic system and political system respectively.</p><p>That put aside, here are some thoughts about a more <a class="link" href="../#amateurs" title="Amateurs vs. Professionals">amateur</a> take on commerce that we can consider:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>I once attended an Israeli <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>-ers meetup (back when LiveJournal was more popular outside Russia) which took place in a vegetarian Indian restaurant. That restaurant allowed one to eat as much as they want from the buffet and pay as much (or as little) as they want.</p><p>Now, I ate some of the food there which was pretty good, and decided to pay 70 <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israeli_new_shekel">ILS</a>. This is whereas I recall that at a time a hamburger meal at a decent restaurant costed between 40 ILS and 50 ILS. Why did I pay so much? Because I appreciated their trust and felt generous.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Creators of digital media (or "content") may opt to initially release their works under relatively restrictive licences such as <a class="link" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons CC-by-nc-sa</a> or <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License">the Affero GPL</a>, and sell commercial or proprietary exceptions to the licence.

This is because I'd rather be considered a <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/gpl-bsd-and-suckerism/">"sucker"</a> than acquire a new enemy.</p><p>Note that the deliverables of a recent commission were <a class="link" href="https://github.com/shlomif/dosbox/commit/50a6334e3713d8647553aa8d1809c0243633cb60">made open source</a> by permission of the customer, because although he paid me to work on some change he needed, he was also happy to share it with the world at large.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Some people online lamented the fact that some <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammy_Award">Grammy Award</a>-winning artists had to use <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patreon">Patreon</a> (or similar) donation pledges to sponsor their albums, but it is quite similar to most philosophers of ancient times, who were entertainers who collected donations from the attendees after their performances.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Counterintuitively, charging more <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-camels-rubber-duckies-11">may yield a bigger demand</a>. In the book <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_(novel)">The Princess Bride</a>, there is the story of a swords' craftsman, whose secret better craftsman delegator was killed by the 6 fingered man, and charged more and more for his now pretty bad results.
