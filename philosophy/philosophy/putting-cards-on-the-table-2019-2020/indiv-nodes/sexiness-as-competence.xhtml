In the United Kingdom, the adjective "fit" has started to mean "sexy", "hot", "attractive" or "desirable" including such MOTAS who are not too athletic.</p><p>Some people may still think that sexual attractiveness is indicative of incompetence and bad form, but the opposite is true. Back when I referred a deaf friend of mine to the video <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21uXcvD5lPs">Daily Gradvice</a> (tongue-in-cheek sex/love/etc. advice by <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Helbig">Grace Helbig</a>) he complained that the quality of the subtitles there (which were generated by automatic <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speech_recognition">Speech recognition</a>) was like "her butt before she cleans it up". I took offence for that because I knew she was a wonderful lady and that was <span class="bold"><strong>because</strong></span> she was so sexy and sexualised, not despite that.</p><a href="../#ftn.daily_gradvice_conclusion" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[conclusion]</sup></a></section></main>
