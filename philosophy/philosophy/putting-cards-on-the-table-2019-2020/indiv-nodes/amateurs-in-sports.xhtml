However, despite all that, they never ruled out that they would one day fight against someone who never faught before, and lose.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers">The Three Musketeers</a>, Dumas tells the story of how d&#8217;Artagnan who is a young swordsman without much of an official training, from a remote region of France, eventually becomes the best fighter in France. This is despite the fact that his peers, Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, have much more experience and training.</p><p>The short-lived sitcom <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenom_(TV_series)">Phenom</a> depicted a young skillful Tennis player whose happiness was ruined due to living in boarding school conditions. Even if she practised more, she lost the psychological war.</p><p>Building on <a class="link" href="../#strategy-for-winning" title="Strategy for Winning">the strategy for winning</a> and <a class="link" href="../#amateurs" title="Amateurs vs. Professionals">amateurs</a> we can see that in ~2022, most good paid sportsmen are increasingly enjoying their work, and don't mind losing too much.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Final">Croatia were the runnerups of the 2018 FIFA world cup</a>, despite being a small country.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/scripps-national-spelling-bee-winners-1440603">8 First Place Winners in a USA National spelling bee</a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>michael phelps record/</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>https://www.essentiallysports.com/atp-tennis-news-jannik-sinner-defeats-vasek-pospisil-to-create-history-in-open-era-tennis/</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4389760/USA-women-s-team-suffer-5-2-loss-FC-Dallas-U-15-boys.html</p></li></ol></div></section></main>
