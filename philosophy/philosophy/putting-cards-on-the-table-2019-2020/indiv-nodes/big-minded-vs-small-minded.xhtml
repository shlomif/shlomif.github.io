It will get easier and faster in time.</p><p>For instance, a vendor on a candy store or an icecream parlour, should try to greet the customers, be friendly to them, offer recommendations to them if they ask, accept business cards with their personal web sites or social media presence and visit them, and generally treat every customer like royalty.</p><p>If you do this, you'll likely get more returning customers, bigger tips, bigger bonuses and raises, and you may be able to land a better job based on a warm recommendation from your superiors and coworkers.</p><p>The opposite is <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micromanagement">Micromanagement</a> where you do exactly as you are told.</p><p>Note that the Nazis' <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superior_orders">Superior orders - "I was only following orders"</a> is orthogonal to this. Despite common belief the Nazis were very <a class="link" href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/top-10-reasons-darth-vader-amazing-project-manager/">big minded / "Rosh Gadol"</a>, which may explain their initial effectiveness.</p><p id="why_nl_princess">One may opt to <span class="bold"><strong>refuse orders</strong></span> completely, and given the bad reputation that Superior orders got recently, the <a class="link" href="https://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/263700.html">"Off with his head"</a> Shakespeare and Lewis Carroll parody of Absolutism is unlikely to happen anywhere. If <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catharina-Amalia,_Princess_of_Orange">the current Dutch heir apparent</a> requests a private jet flight at nighttime for a non-Emergency (which is what foolishly killed <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a> and her father, and six other people), she will probably be refused. She is unlikely to request that anyway but that is besides the point. <a href="../#ftn.why_nl_princess" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[Why I picked the Dutch princess?]</sup></a></p><p>If your superior in any way requests something reasonable, you should comply with their request and be bigminded about it. But feel free to refuse harmful orders or requests. Despite common belief, this should not cause anarchy, but rather bring peace and prosperity.</p><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr class="footnote-hr"/><div id="ftn.why_nl_princess" class="footnote"><p><a href="../#why_nl_princess" class="para"><sup class="para">[Why I picked the Dutch princess?] </sup></a>I picked her simply because she is older than Queen Elizabeth II's oldest great-grandchild.</p></div></div></section></main>
