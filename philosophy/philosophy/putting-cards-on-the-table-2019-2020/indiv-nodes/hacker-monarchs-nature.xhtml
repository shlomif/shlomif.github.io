A messiah also attempts to always think a few steps ahead.</p><p>A hacker monarch believes that the correct answer to the question "Who is the most powerful person on Earth?" is "I am". Furthermore, the only less powerful people are those who answer otherwise.</p><p>They also know they can improve themselves, improve the world at large, and enjoy themselves at the same time.</p><p>In addition, a hacker monarch wishes no man or woman to unnecessarily suffer or die prematurely and from unnatural causes. They also want <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect">every person and collective to improve and become better</a> (= the Pygmalion effect as opposed to <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_effect">the Golem effect</a>).</p><p>A hacker monarch <span class="bold"><strong>is</strong></span> <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">their brothers&#8217; keeper</span>&#8221;</span> to paraphrase on <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cain_and_Abel">the Cain and Abel myth</a>. For example <a class="link" href="../#Christina_Grimmie" title="Christina Grimmie (1994 - 2016; RIP)">Christina Grimmie</a> has tried to adapt herself and her work to what she thought others wanted for several years before her assassination at age 22 (by a fan who killed himself later almost immediately). While it was ultimately her fault, she had many fans and viewers and friends who could have noticed (including I).</p></section></main>
