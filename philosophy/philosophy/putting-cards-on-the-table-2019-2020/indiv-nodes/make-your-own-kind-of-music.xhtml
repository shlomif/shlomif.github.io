But these qualities are part of what makes us who we are.</p><p id="Cimorelli-ren">The YouTuber band <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cimorelli">Cimorelli</a> has used the fact that they are six sisters (who also have five male brothers) in a large Roman Catholic family, a trend which has received a lot of antagonism, from environmentalists, psychologists and the media, to their advantage, and as a gimmick. As a result, they published many videos of them covering hit songs, some original songs, and have been live performing and collaborating with other singers and entertainers.</p><p>Naturally, they are not the only YouTube success story. But if you get an opportunity, seize it. Were you invited to give a talk? Go for it. Even if you were invited from the "wrong" reason, you will pave the road for future lecturers. A sociology student invited you to talk to them about your work as an open source / open content creator? Go for it. You thought of a new <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">Chuck Norris/etc. factoid</a>? Write it down and share it on social media and chat. Someone asked you out and you like them and are single? Go for it. You have an idea for a nice video, story, screenplay, song, etc. Execute it.</p><p>I used to be jealous of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayn_Rand">Ayn Rand</a> for writing so lucidly and coherently in <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fountainhead"><span class="emphasis"><em>The Fountainhead</em></span></a> and in <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlas_Shrugged"><span class="emphasis"><em>Atlas Shrugged</em></span></a>, whereas my style of screenplays and stories was what I described as <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staccato">"staccato"</a> where I do not mention any unnecessary details. However, Rand likely felt the same way about <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fyodor_Dostoevsky">Dostoevsky</a> and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Tolstoy">Tolstoy</a>, whose overly verbose style is now the terror and hatred of many Literature students.</p><p>Similarly, current and future generations will likely appreciate my staccato style more than Ayn Rand&#8217;s. Make your own kind of music!</p></section></main>
