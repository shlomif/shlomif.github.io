It says, <span class="bold"><strong>&#8220;All Truth is God&#8217;s Truth.&#8221;</strong></span> And I believe that. The most viable belief systems are those that can reach out and incorporate new ideas, new memes, new metaphors, new interfaces, new extensions, new ways of doing things. My goal this year is to try to get Perl to reach out and cooperate with Java. I know it may be difficult for some of you to swallow, but Java is not the enemy. Nor is Lisp, or Python, or Tcl. That is not to say that these languages don't have good and bad points. I am not a cultural relativist. Nor am I a linguistic relativist. In case you hadn't noticed. :-)</p></blockquote></div><p><a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/philosophy/guide-to-neo-tech/">Neo-Tech noted something similar:</a></p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>"Truth" is a mushy, polyhydra word; everyone disputes its meaning.</p></blockquote></div><p>A variant of an insight by <a class="link" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr">Niels Bohr</a> goes:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>The opposite of a correct statement is a false statement. But the opposite of a profound truth may well be another profound truth.</p></blockquote></div><p>Moreover, I <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/1351069373952360448">noted in a tweet</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Not only is "All Truth is God's Truth", but "truth" is a function of time. If everyone copied solutions in <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Euler">Project Euler</a> there'd be far more people who solved more than 400 problems, but people are more honest today.</p></blockquote></div><p>Moreover, note that like <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_truth_is_out_there">the X-files motto</a> goes, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">The truths are out there</span>&#8221;</span>. The media, including Internet sites, blogs, and social media (and I may err on it too some time), will always emit a lot of static <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise">white noise</a> in all directions (for example see my notes about <a class="link" href="../#paris_hilton">Paris Hilton</a> later), but people <span class="bold"><strong>can</strong></span> tell the truth. The <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">Bible</a> depicts acts of massacre, adultery, and incest that would seem appalling, and which historians believe were common back then (see e.g: <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levite%27s_concubine">Levite&#8217;s concubine</a>). Nevertheless, generations of children (and adults) who read it, knew better than to emulate that.</p><p>Do note that there is a place for logical absolutism (= <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">1. A is A. 2. A is not not-A. 3. Every entity is either A or not-A.</span>&#8221;</span>; <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_logic">term logic</a>/etc.) - without it mathematics won't be possible, nor will most modern engineering, computers (including many embedded and mobile devices), and computer networking. But I tend to agree with Bohr that often we can look at a more humane or spiritual issue from two different valid sides.</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>&#8220;The fundamental cause of the trouble is that in the modern world the stupid are cocksure while the intelligent are full of doubt.&#8221; &#8212; <a class="link" href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Bertrand_Russell">Bertrand Russell</a></p></blockquote></div><p>I think that having doubts likely plays a part in making people wiser.</p><p>Like <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn!_Turn!_Turn!">Ecclesiastes</a> noted:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose under the heaven:</p><p>A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, a time to reap that which is planted;</p><p>A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and a time to build up;</p></blockquote></div><p>One should apply judgement in reasoning.</p></section></main>
