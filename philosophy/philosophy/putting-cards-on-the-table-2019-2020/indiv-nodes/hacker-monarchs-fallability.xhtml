Socrates almost got himself killed several times, and then he willingly drank the poison and died. Plato and Aristotle said equally blasphemous things, but learned from Socrates' fate and worked on better delivery so both died as highly revered and respected. The same story repeated itself during the Renaissance with Galileo and Isaac Newton.</p><p>Many Hacker Monarchs were two steps forward and one step back, like the fact Ayn Rand was <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/culture/case-for-commercial-fan-fiction/#open_free_share_steal">anti-Open</a> and <a class="link" href="../#amateurs" title="Amateurs vs. Professionals">anti-Amateur</a> and <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=neo-tech-selfishness">confused selfishness with rational self growth</a>.</p><p>Moreover, I still resent the fact that the characters in <span class="emphasis"><em>Buffy</em></span> were competent, but on the other hand socially inept and lacked sexual assertiveness. This is a false dichotomy that I tried to rectify in <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">my stories and screenplays</a> where the characters are both competent and socially capable.</p><p>Having read <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Musketeers"><span class="emphasis"><em>The Three Musketeers</em></span></a>, Dumas&#8217; magnus opus, I recall feeling intimated by the competence and resourcefulness of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de Winter</a>, until I eventually realised that despite being the antagonist, or because of that, she was the ultimate good in the book, and she became my epitome of sexiness in fiction. I disliked the fact that Dumas killed her so much, that I set out to carve different destinies for her in <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Selina-Mandrake/"><span class="emphasis"><em>Selina Mandrake - The Slayer</em></span></a> and for <a class="link" href="https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Faith_Lehane">Faith</a> (her rough equivalent in <span class="emphasis"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></span>) in <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Buffy/A-Few-Good-Slayers/"><span class="emphasis"><em>Buffy - a Few Good Slayers</em></span></a>.</p><p>So if you have a criticism against even the greatest hackers, voice it - we <a class="link" href="http://shlomifishswiki.branchable.com/Encourage_criticism_and_try_to_get_offended/">can only benefit from it</a>.
