That is the "fox in a chickens' coop" motif as exemplified in <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_(Genesis)">the story of Joseph in prison in the Bible</a>, and that of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milady_de_Winter">Milady de Winter in "The Three Musketeers"</a>, and in the film <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Juan_DeMarco">"Don Juan DeMarco"</a> . In <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/Summerschool-at-the-NSA/">my "Summerschool at the NSA" screenplay</a>, a fictionalised <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/Summer-Glau/">Summer Glau</a> (the actress who is notable for being featured in <a class="link" href="https://xkcd.com/406/">xkcd: Venting</a> ) is the fox (pardon the pun) who devours the hens of the fictionalised NSA.</p><p>I, Shlomi Fish, have done the same in real life in a top security Israeli psychiatric ward where I was hospitalised for being non normative, and for doing some foolish stuff. It worked surprisingly well, and I've used the collected wisdom of Moses&#8594;Saladin&#8594;Ayn Rand&#8594;the Beatles&#8594;Sesame Street&#8594;web 2.0 blogs and sites&#8594;My Little Pony / Taylor Swift and my own intuition and trial and error.</p><p>It took me about 6-to-8 weeks, and I suffered from the conditions of the hospital, but otherwise was able to hone my skills in benevolent psychological warfare, and also started writing some essays with my limited computing resources there.</p></section></main>
