And it can be summarised by the famous adages <a class="link" href="https://mygeekwisdom.com/2011/09/12/be-excellent-to-each-other/">"Be excellent to each other"</a> and <a class="link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wheatons-law">"Don't be a dick." (= Wheaton's Law)</a>.</p><p>If you interact with a fellow person, shake his hand. Expect <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygmalion_effect">everyone to improve and become better</a> (= the Pygmalion effect as opposed to <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golem_effect">the Golem effect</a>) and act accordingly.</p><p>Thank someone for doing something you like. But be honest and tell someone if you dislike some action he took, or one of their works/creations (even if you feel they are your superior).</p><p>Express interest in the other person. Ask them "What's up?", "What's new?", etc. If he says "nothing much" tell them <a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/shlomif/status/635904227890458624">they should try to be less boring than that</a>.</p><p>I recall that during <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_FIFA_World_Cup_Final">the 2018 FIFA World Cup Final</a>, the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolinda_Grabar-Kitarovi%C4%87">Croatian president</a>, who is a woman, was so sweet and hugged all the (male) players of both teams: her native country, Croatia &#8212; and France &#8212; which won the match.</p><p id="comedy_serious">Similarly, <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_II">Queen Elizabeth II</a> has reportedly recently <a class="link" href="https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/guest-honour-queen-leaves-couple-685253">actually attended</a> a wedding to which a British couple invited her as a joke.<a href="../#ftn.comedy_serious" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[comedy-is-serious]</sup></a></p><p>Sometimes people may refuse to interact with you, in that case say: &#171;OK, no problem, have a nice day!&#187;</p><p>It is also a good idea to compliment your friends and acquaintances, of whatever sex, for their looks. I recall telling a gorgeous young woman who came to visit one of the fellow patients in the hospital: "You are beautiful", and she thanked me for that, and noted that nobody had told her that in several years. (Which made me sad.)</p><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="dont-be-afraid-to-ask-for-help" class="title">Don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for help</h4></header><p>One important thing to note is that we all have our limitations and we are not good at everything.

For example, I prefer not to cook complex meals myself, because cooking and learning to cook would be a grand <a class="link" href="../#time-is-much-more-important-than-money" title="Time &gt;&gt; Money">waste of time</a> for me and I'd produce mediocre at best results.</p><p>For some inspiration you may wish to listen to the Beatles' songs <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help!_(song)">"Help!"</a> and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_a_Little_Help_from_My_Friends">"With a Little Help from My Friends"</a>.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="pick-up-art" class="title">Thoughts about how to Approach a MOTAS</h4></header><p>"Be excellent to each other" and being honest has implications with respect to how a man or a woman should approach a member of the appropriate sex (or <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/M/MOTAS.html">MOTAS</a>). If you are interested in testing the waters for a long-term relationship, then a good strategy will be to simply say: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Hi, I like you and think you are beautiful/handsome/cute/hot/sexy/gorgeous/etc. What do you say we go on a date?</span>&#8221;</span> Either he or she will agree, or you have wasted much less time.</p><p id="shlomifish_org_in_israel">Note that girls should feel free to approach guys this way too. In my <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">stories</a>, I have tried to encourage women to become more sexually assertive, but it seems that most Israeli girls did not get the memo, and are still shy and playing it hard to get. <a href="../#ftn.shlomifish_org_in_israel" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[israeli-popularity]</sup></a></p><p>What if you are interested in a one off sexual intercourse? Nothing wrong with that. You can learn about how to do it from Jazz (= the name of one of the characters) from the show <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>. As he said in a <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcD7hvH0Wk8">an excerpt from an episode</a>: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">let's go get some barbecue and get busy</span>&#8221;</span>.
