If you are interested in testing the waters for a long-term relationship, then a good strategy will be to simply say: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Hi, I like you and think you are beautiful/handsome/cute/hot/sexy/gorgeous/etc. What do you say we go on a date?</span>&#8221;</span> Either he or she will agree, or you have wasted much less time.</p><p id="shlomifish_org_in_israel">Note that girls should feel free to approach guys this way too. In my <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">stories</a>, I have tried to encourage women to become more sexually assertive, but it seems that most Israeli girls did not get the memo, and are still shy and playing it hard to get. <a href="../#ftn.shlomifish_org_in_israel" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[israeli-popularity]</sup></a></p><p>What if you are interested in a one off sexual intercourse? Nothing wrong with that. You can learn about how to do it from Jazz (= the name of one of the characters) from the show <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fresh_Prince_of_Bel-Air">The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air</a>. As he said in a <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcD7hvH0Wk8">an excerpt from an episode</a>: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">let's go get some barbecue and get busy</span>&#8221;</span>. Or as DAILY GRADVICE put it for a girl trying to seduce a guy: <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21uXcvD5lPs">"I want you to sail your dick ship into my lady port."</a>.</p><p>Naturally, it doesn't have to be these exact words, but the point stands: be honest, sincere, and candid, cut to the chase and don't play games.</p></section></main>
