The most viable belief systems are those that can reach out and incorporate new ideas, new memes, new metaphors, new interfaces, new extensions, new ways of doing things. My goal this year is to try to get Perl to reach out and cooperate with Java. I know it may be difficult for some of you to swallow, but Java is not the enemy. Nor is Lisp, or Python, or Tcl. That is not to say that these languages don't have good and bad points. I am not a cultural relativist. Nor am I a linguistic relativist.

Whatever your choice will be, I'll accept it.</p></blockquote></div><p>While some knights were probably killed, many of them survived and became happy, sane, and while ostensibly Christian, unwilling to fight Saladin. Even if their religious leaders told them to return, Saladin told them he is OK with the oath breaking and said he'll fight them again. This caused his opponents to fight extremely poorly, and be quickly disarmed. Following that, they learned their lesson, and would not fight Saladin again.</p><p>By letting people do what they want, they will likely do the best thing they can do.

I also said the high fee may yield <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=joel-camels-rubber-duckies-11">a higher demand</a>. Then, since I had a browser window open with the most followed Twitter accounts and <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Taylor Swift</a> was there, I noted she likely charges more than 300 USD/hour for her live shows. He told me that she shared her name with that language, and I noted that she should sue Apple for trademark violations of the supposed "Swift" trademark - and win. I joked that if "Apple sued Taylor Swift for violation of their Apple Swift language's trademark they will spend all their money in the bank on litigation and still lose.". Ha ha only serious.</p><p>I then realised that Ms. Swift has become a <a class="link" href="#hacker-monarchs" title="The Hacker Monarchs / Messiahs">Hacker Queen</a> by that time. While I think her face is good eye candy, she is not that beautiful in my opinion (but I think she looks <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdneKLhsWOQ">much hotter with black hair</a> than with her trademark blonde hair). Nevertheless, there are many things we can learn from her.</p><p>First of all is that she exemplifies the <a class="link" href="#amateurs" title="Amateurs vs. Professionals">amateur model</a>, because she does stuff for fun, rather than for money.</p><p>Her videos despite often being popular probably do not offset their production value in ads, but they are good publicity, provide fodder for remixes, parodies and covers, and are fun enough to produce so she can afford to offset the cost. She doesn't work for money or even for a shitload of money. She works for fun.</p><p>Moreover, Taylor is an unapologetic <a class="link" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/attention_whore">"attention whore"</a> who often spends large amounts of money or even also time in activities that will make her look like a better person or more well known. Note that per <a class="link" href="https://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/16006/jewish/Chapter-9.htm">Jeremiah chapter 9 22-23</a>, <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">Thus says the Lord: Let not the wise man boast of his wisdom, nor the strong man boast of his strength, nor the rich man boast of his riches.

Furthermore, to paraphrase <a class="link" href="https://m.imdb.com/title/tt0106941/">the film "For Love or Money"</a> she doesn't do it because she seeks attention - she does it because she cares.</p><p>Otherwise, Taylor Swift is a great philanthropist who likely <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=shlomif-fact-taylor-swift-6">also donates to friendly individuals</a> and realises that one should <a class="link" href="https://biblehub.com/ecclesiastes/11-1.htm">"cast your bread upon the waters"</a> to quote the wonderful Biblical scroll of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a>.</p><p>One advice I can give to Ms. Swift is to stop "speaking in riddles" which was also an issue of <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terry_Pratchett">Terry Pratchett&#8217;s books</a> and previously Ayn Rand's. I registered that idiom from the lyrics of <a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNzj55CEoMI">a cover of Swift's song "Ours"</a> (which I now much malign). I recommend she start writing a public snapshot of her personal philosophy ("Taytayism" or whatever) similar to my <a class="link" href="https://github.com/shlomif/putting-cards-2019-2020">repository of this very document</a>.

It is well known that Norris took the facts to his advantage, and as a result became the most prominent actor in Hollywood (which I call "the Alpha Male"). However, shortly afterwards, the factoids seem to have fallen out of favour, and some time after that, Norris announced that he retired from acting.</p><p>Now, I still added factoids about other subjects <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/humour/bits/facts/">to my collection</a>. Then one day in 2019, I was chatting on the #gnu chat room on <a class="link" href="https://freenode.net/">freenode</a> and after giving someone some advice, I came up with a new factoid which I uttered there: <span class="quote">&#8220;<span class="quote">If Chuck Norris gives you some advice, and you do not follow it, he'll survive. However, you likely won't.</span>&#8221;</span>. To my surprise, my fellow to the conversation, told me it was funny. Some days later I spent some time with my sister's husband, who is an artist and a film maker, and showed him some of the software applications and web services, which I was familiar with as a <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux">Linux (or rather "GNU/Linux")</a> user and developer. Then, just when he and my sister were going away, I told him I had some factoids on my site about Chuck Norris/etc., and he told me he was a big fan of those.</p><p>So what has happened?</p><p>What I think happened is that Norris started playing (and fighting) in roles he liked, even if he didn't get paid or got paid relatively little, or was paid after the fact. He became a happy <a class="link" href="#amateurs" title="Amateurs vs. Professionals">amateur</a> rather than an increasingly unhappy professional. I won't be surprised if he has agreed to appear at local schools' plays, and/or playing roles that were seemingly unlike his traditional Hollywood roles - just because he liked them.</p><p>As a result of that, I believe Chuck Norris, both himself and the fictionalised Chuck Norris Facts image, has become a new <a class="link" href="#hacker-monarchs" title="The Hacker Monarchs / Messiahs">Hacker Monarch</a>.

I vividly recall one excerpt from the very first Sherlock Holmes story <a class="link" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet">A Study in Scarlet</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he appeared to know next to nothing. Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he enquired in the naivest way who he might be and what he had done. My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System. That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.</p><p>"You appear to be astonished," he said, smiling at my expression of surprise. "Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it."</p><p>"To forget it!"</p><p>"You see," he explained, "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones."</p><p>"But the Solar System!" I protested.</p><p>"What the deuce is it to me?" he interrupted impatiently; "you say that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work."</p></blockquote></div><p>(<a class="link" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_Study_in_Scarlet/Part_1/Chapter_2">Chapter 2 of A Study in Scarlet</a> by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, under the public domain in most countries.)</p><p>Conan Doyle was naturally exaggerating here in portraying the ideal of Sherlock Holmes (as few, if any, human beings can forget that the Earth revolves around the Sun), but the principle still stands: we need to make a conscious decision of how to manage our memory, because there is a limit to how many different aspects can put inside our resident memory, or otherwise we'll forget more important stuff.</p><p>So what does it has to do with the Awk programming language? Many decades after A Study in Scarlet, <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a> had this to say in his book <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/"><span class="emphasis"><em>The Art of Unix Programming</em></span></a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A case study of awk is included to point out that it is not a model for emulation; in fact, since 1990 it has largely fallen out of use. It has been superseded by new-school scripting languages&#8212;notably Perl, which was explicitly designed to be an awk killer. The reasons are worthy of examination, because they constitute a bit of a cautionary tale for minilanguage designers.</p><p>The awk language was originally designed to be a small, expressive special-purpose language for report generation. Unfortunately, it turns out to have been designed at a bad spot on the complexity-vs.-power curve. The action language is noncompact, but the pattern-driven framework it sits inside keeps it from being generally applicable &#8212; that's the worst of both worlds. And the new-school scripting languages can do anything awk can; their equivalent programs are usually just as readable, if not more so.</p><p>For a few years after the release of Perl in 1987, awk remained competitive simply because it had a smaller, faster implementation. But as the cost of compute cycles and memory dropped, the economic reasons for favoring a special-purpose language that was relatively thrifty with both lost their force. Programmers increasingly chose to do awklike things with Perl or (later) Python, rather than <span class="strong"><strong>keep two different scripting languages in their heads</strong></span>.[90] By the year 2000 awk had become little more than a memory for most old-school Unix hackers, and not a particularly nostalgic one.</p><p>Falling costs have changed the tradeoffs in minilanguage design. Restricting your design's capabilities to buy compactness may still be a good idea, but doing so to economize on machine resources is a bad one.
