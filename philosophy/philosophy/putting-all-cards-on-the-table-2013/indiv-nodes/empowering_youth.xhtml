Today, most people graduate from high school at that age, and are expected to remain disadvantaged until then. There isn&#8217;t a good reason why the youth of today should not be able to make useful contributions to arts, sciences, philosophy, and entertainment, despite their young age and inexperience.</p><p>Here are some examples:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Dmitri Gaskin is a core developer of both jQuery and Drupal and gave a <a class="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8mwKq7_JlS8">talk about jQuery on Google Tech Talks</a>, while being 12 years old.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Maria Aragon was 10 years old when she was recorded performing <a class="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xG0wi1m-89o">a cover</a> of Lady Gaga&#8217;s song &#8220;Born This Way&#8221;, which has received over 50 million views on YouTube as of April 2013 (and which I like better than the original).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Much previously, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samantha_Smith">Samantha Smith</a> changed the fate of the cold war, when being 10 years old, by the simple act of writing a letter.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In the 18th century, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> started making important contributions to mathematics from a very early age.</p></li></ol></div><p>Our contemporary culture expects kids (what Americans refer to as children, &#8220;pre-teens&#8221;, and &#8220;teenagers&#8221;) to remain &#8220;innocent&#8221;, na&#239;ve and inexperienced, and immature, and, as a result, most of them behave accordingly.</p><p>As I noted previously, Jennifer Lawrence was unusual in having received the Oscar&#8217;s at the relatively young age of 22. ( Previously, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlee_Matlin">Marlee Matlin</a> won it when she was 21 years old, back in 1986, but it was an isolated case. ). I anticipate, and hope, that Lawrence&#8217;s winning will bring forth an age where some even younger film makers, receive the Academy Awards. Perhaps as young as being 10 years old - perhaps younger.</p><p>The Internet and other modern technologies empower many other previously encumbered sections of the population aside from people of certain ages, but it's high time we recognise, that we enter a world where young people are more empowered.</p></section></main>
