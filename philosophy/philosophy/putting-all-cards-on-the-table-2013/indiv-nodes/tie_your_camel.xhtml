<section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="tie_your_camel" class="title">&#8220;Put your faith in Allah, but tie your camel&#8221;</h3><h:a class="back_to_faq" href="../#tie_your_camel">Node Link</h:a></header><p>The tale (a Hadith) tells that Muhammad saw a shepherd going to pray, while keeping his Camel untied. He asked the shepherd why he kept his camel untied and the shepherd told him: &#8220;I put my faith in Allah, that the Camel won&#8217;t escape&#8221;. So Muhammad told him, and I paraphrase: &#8220;Dude, it doesn't work that way! Camels can escape due to nature&#8217;s whims. So: put your faith in Allah, but, for the love of God - tie your Camel.&#8221; (I am an Israeli, agnostic, non-religious, Jew but I think I can borrow useful memes from Islam, or whatever, if I think they have merit, right? See <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">Ad-hominem</a>.)</p><p>As much as I admire God for his wonderful creation, I still have to help myself, and help him help me. I also am not sure whether I will continue to live after I die, so I'd rather not risk it. God&#8217;s creation is wonderful, but there's always a risk I'm being toyed by some <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_demon">evil genius</a> (or what Descartes called the &#8220;evil demon&#8221;) and that reality is not what it seems to be (see Descartes&#8217; <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cogito_ergo_sum">&#8220;I think therefore I am&#8221;</a> thought experiment, and naturally The Matrix concept from <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix">the first &#8220;The Matrix&#8221; film</a>). Alternatively, it is possible that God does not exist, and reality is simply whimsical and random, but still enabled the creation of life, intelligence, and finally - human consciousness.</p><p>So it may sound far-fetched to you, but I don't want to die - not now, not in a thousand years - not ever. Maybe it's a scary thought, but I have accepted it now, and wish to enjoy youth rejuvenating biological immortality. And I don't want me or any of the living heroes I admire in the present, both those that I know and those that I have only heard about (including some people I have a feud with, but still know are mostly good people), to ever have to die due to old age, accidents, or misfortune.</p></section></main>
