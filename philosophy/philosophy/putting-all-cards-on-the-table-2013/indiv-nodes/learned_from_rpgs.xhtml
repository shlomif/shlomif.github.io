The first one was about the importance of being <span class="bold"><strong>resourceful</strong></span>: think outside the box, come up with creative solutions, don&#8217;t think in terms of yes vs. no.</p><p>The second one is the D&amp;D concept of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_point">experience points</a> which the characters gain and later can invest in improving their skills or acquiring new ones. Real life has a similar concept: time. We can spend our time performing tasks, which in turn will enhance one or more of our skills. The time one spends writing an essay, a blog post or a story, will enhance their writing skills, and their personal philosophy, and will make it easier for them to write more in the future. The time invested cooking will make one a better cook, and will make it easier to cook in the future.</p><p>The more time we invest in honing a certain skill, the easier it is to become better and better in it.</p><p>One complication to all that is the sad phenomenon of <a class="link" href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/44643.html">&#8220;Psyche Death&#8221; or &#8220;Growth Death&#8221;</a> where a person become more and more cynical and their mind deteriorates, while he continues to be alive. This makes the sum of his abilities and skills lesser and lesser. But a person can reverse their psyche death or growth death easily enough by first acknowledging it and then reversing it.</p></section></main>
