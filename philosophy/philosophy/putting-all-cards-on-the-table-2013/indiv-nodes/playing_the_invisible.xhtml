However, having read in several places that &#8220;The Invisible Hacker is the most powerful&#8221; (a hacker is a talented worker that bends the rules, and for what &#8220;hacker&#8221; means, see <a class="link" href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">&#8220;How to become a hacker&#8221;</a> and Paul Graham&#8217;s <a class="link" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html">The word &#8220;Hacker&#8221;</a>), I decided to play it &#8220;The Invisible&#8221;. So I remained a relatively unknown software developer based in Tel Aviv, Israel, who studied Electrical Engineering in the Technion, who was constantly looking for jobs, and who found a lot of joy in working on <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">his personal web site</a>, various pieces of open source software, and has been doing a lot of one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many communications on the Internet. I was happy, but constantly had periods of hypomanias.</p><p>I gradually felt that I was controlling everything behind the scenes, and finding trends right before they became mainstream, and having slowly gained popularity by word of mouth, and influencing people, but I kinda hated it. Some people can be quiet and benevolent value producers doing ordinary things. But not me - I want to be very good, not play &#8220;The Invisible&#8221;. I am not a follower of trends - I set trends. And I want to be recognised for the truly great accomplishments that I have accomplished, am still accomplishing, and am planning on continuing to accomplish.</p><p>Note that this is not about being what Americans call &#8220;a winner&#8221; and win 1st place at some silly competition of who has the highest grade average or the highest television rating ever. I don't care about that too much, but I do care about being acknowledged. My stories are not perfect, but it is their imperfection and sometimes sloppiness that makes them perfect.</p></section></main>
