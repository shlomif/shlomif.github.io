<section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="honesty" class="title">Honesty</h3><h:a class="back_to_faq" href="../#honesty">Node Link</h:a></header><p>People who are into the Internet world have probably ran into the recent trend about &#8220;openness&#8221; - open source software (such as the Firefox and the Google Chromium browsers, the VLC video player, various Peer-to-Peer programs, etc.), open and documented protocols and specifications, large-scale and small-scale open "content" collaborative projects (most notably the Wikipedias, many other Wikimedia projects, and many other wikis), and lots of other stuff. Yet, openness is also mostly a synonym for such things as &#8220;honesty&#8221; and &#8220;sincerity&#8221;: not lying, being direct, and not hiding things. It also means not playing games with people and being happy for their happiness and success, rather than being consumed with jealousy or (God help me) envy (which means you wish to destroy these values, rather than coveting them for your own).</p><p>So why is it important? Because you should be honest in everything you do. Do you like a member-of-the-appropriate-sex (MOTAS) that already is in a relationship? Admit it to him or her, but be happy for them, and tell them you can be on the rebound or if they have any friends who are looking for a significant other. That put aside even the most noble gentlemen (and ladies) and those that are happily married and possibly even have children, are allowed to flirt with other MOTAS.</p><p>Did your friend, spouse, a celebrity of some sort, or a complete stranger you heard of, who seems nice, get a good opportunity? You can admit you are jealous, but try to keep it at bay, and be happy for them.</p><p>Here&#8217;s <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=almost-worthy">what I wrote</a> when two of my best friends - a great male software developer (and a great hacker) called Omer, and a wonderful female software developer (and a great hacker) called Chen (= a Hebrew first name meaning &#8220;grace&#8221; or &#8220;loveliness&#8221; which is common among both boys and girls) got married:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Hi Omer! Mazal Tov on Chen and yours marriage. It reminds me of a quote from Charlotte Bronte&#8217;s Jane Eyre:</p><p>&#8220;At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, <span class="bold"><strong>almost worthy of such a wife</strong></span>) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.&#8221;</p><p>Well, in your case I can say that <span class="bold"><strong>both of you are almost worthy of each other</strong></span>. Congrats again!</p></blockquote></div><p>As much as I was attracted to Chen (and she likes a lot of the stuff I created too), I didn&#8217;t try to break their relationship, and have her for myself, and wished them happiness. And I did it, because I knew there were plenty of wonderful female hackers (including those that are still not very good at computers, or even hate them) and I can eventually find a good one of my own. And I also knew that coming between Chen and Omer, will make both of them unhappy, and that's not what I want.</p><p>People may appear to not appreciate you being sincere with them, but believe me, that it will pay in spades later on, also because you'll feel better about yourself, and be happier, more peaceful, and more competent.</p><p>The same thing applies to jobs and work. You shouldn't lie on your job interview. Is the company developing in Java and you don't like Java a lot? Admit it. Say that you prefer not to work long hours because people are <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Hoffman">more productive working during sane hours</a>. If you contribute to the Wikipedia or to open source software, admit it, because workplaces that dislike such things about their employees, will likely not be places you'd like to work with. And yes, it means that you should be able to freely talk and admit everything about you (that you are an Israeli, a Jew, a Black person, a Catholic, a Muslim, straight, gay, anti-religious, homophobic, or whatever) instead of the silly laws that try to prevent discrimination and wish to &#8220;streamline&#8221; the interview while deliberately going against the liberty of speech.</p><p>Fact of the matter is, you are allowed to discriminate, even in accepting positions. I did not get many jobs despite feeling that I have done extremely well on the Interviews, yet I would not dream of suing the workplace for not accepting me. I accepted whatever reasons they had for deciding against me. Furthermore, sometimes I was fired or laid off based on various reasons, and I also accepted my fate and moved on, because working for a certain workplace was not something I was entitled to &#8212; it was a privilege.</p></section></main>
