However, having read in several places that &#8220;The Invisible Hacker is the most powerful&#8221; (a hacker is a talented worker that bends the rules, and for what &#8220;hacker&#8221; means, see <a class="link" href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">&#8220;How to become a hacker&#8221;</a> and Paul Graham&#8217;s <a class="link" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html">The word &#8220;Hacker&#8221;</a>), I decided to play it &#8220;The Invisible&#8221;. So I remained a relatively unknown software developer based in Tel Aviv, Israel, who studied Electrical Engineering in the Technion, who was constantly looking for jobs, and who found a lot of joy in working on <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/">his personal web site</a>, various pieces of open source software, and has been doing a lot of one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-many communications on the Internet. I was happy, but constantly had periods of hypomanias.</p><p>I gradually felt that I was controlling everything behind the scenes, and finding trends right before they became mainstream, and having slowly gained popularity by word of mouth, and influencing people, but I kinda hated it. Some people can be quiet and benevolent value producers doing ordinary things. But not me - I want to be very good, not play &#8220;The Invisible&#8221;. I am not a follower of trends - I set trends. And I want to be recognised for the truly great accomplishments that I have accomplished, am still accomplishing, and am planning on continuing to accomplish.</p><p>Note that this is not about being what Americans call &#8220;a winner&#8221; and win 1st place at some silly competition of who has the highest grade average or the highest television rating ever. I don't care about that too much, but I do care about being acknowledged. My stories are not perfect, but it is their imperfection and sometimes sloppiness that makes them perfect.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="the_technion_and_loser" class="title">The Technion and the American concept of &#8220;Loser&#8221; and &#8220;Winner&#8221;</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/the_technion_and_loser.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technion_%E2%80%93_Israel_Institute_of_Technology">The Technion in Haifa, Israel</a>, where I studied for my Bachelor of Science degree, is overall a fine institute to study in, but it has several problems. One problem is that it is &#8220;90% work / 10% play&#8221; instead of say &#8220;70% work / 30% play&#8221;, because there&#8217;s a strong discipline to study and only that. But an even graver problem is the fact that the faculty prefer the scores of their tests to be an approximate <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a> (or Gaussian) which makes many people who studied hard frustrated at their low grades. A better strategy would be to give a solid workload during the semester, and then to have a <span class="bold"><strong>relatively</strong></span> easy test, so people who studied hard during the semester will easily pass with a high score, while the slackers will still fail.</p><p>It seems like there's a similar problem with <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology">MIT (the Massachusetts Institute of Technology)</a>, but whereas in MIT they have a major problem with suicides of people who had straight A's in high school and became C average students in MIT., I have yet to hear of a Technion student who committed suicide because of low grades. Why? Because Israelis don't have the obsession which Americans have, about not being a &#8220;loser&#8221;. Technion students know best to realise that their low grades are not their own fault, but rather the fault of the institution's general policy.</p><p>I received some flak due to this. One Technion professor (who graduated from MIT) once asked me why my grade average was relatively low. I told him I had better things to do with my time, and did not want to invest the much extra time in getting perfect scores, and that I never took a course or a test again if I got a passing grade (no matter how low). I spent many hours during my Technion years, working on my Internet web site, and on open source software, interacting with my fellow students, browsing the web for information and knowledge, etc.. All these later on provided fodder for my works of fiction, humour and philosophy. So I knew that I was right in trying to enhance my general skill-set instead of just my grades.</p><p>Some Americans may think I&#8217;m a &#8220;loser&#8221; for finishing with an average grade of only 84.6% (which still made me a cum-laude student), instead of one in the high 90s, and not being able to persist in the same job for a long time since. But I&#8217;m not competing like an Olympic athlete at some track race on life. Life is meant to be enjoyed - it is not a silly race.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="silver_linings_playbook" class="title">Silver Linings Playbook</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/silver_linings_playbook.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>A good friend recommended me to watch the film <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Linings_Playbook"><span class="emphasis"><em>Silver Linings Playbook</em></span></a>, and told me it sported a man who had <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bipolar_disorder">Bipolar disorder (or &#8220;Manic Depressive disorder&#8221;)</a>, which is something I have been suffering from as well. I watched the film and found it imperfect: slow starting, irresponsible, and a little depressing at times. But it was a great film, with some great acting, many jokes and many awkward and funny situations, and many details I could relate to. So it was perfect simply because it was imperfect. Films that are too perfect are too boring.</p><p>Anyway, the theme of the film was that you can be happy and content even if it appears you are a &#8220;loser&#8221;. Despite the fact that I am still living with my parents at 35, that I've never been in a relationship with a girl (and I am a straight guy), that I had a hard time keeping a job as a programmer, and it's been a while since I've gone out of Israel, I am not a loser, and neither probably are you.</p><p>That put aside, I still want fame, recognition, money, and becoming a household name.

Yes, in The Fountainhead, unlike in my parody and modernisation of it which I called <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/TOneW-the-Fountainhead/">&#8220;The One With The Fountainhead&#8221;</a>, World War II is not prevented, and the characters each end up unhappy. On the other hand, in my parody, Dominique Francon becomes the president of the United States, Roark is her husband and father of her children and decides to pursue a career in palaeontology (having reached saturation as an architect), Toohey starts a new career as an excellent saxophone player, and Gail Wynand transforms his newspaper empire into something more benevolent.</p><p>Furthermore, it is clear from the Fountainhead that like Howard Roark, Ayn Rand expected fortune and success to come to her at the time without her doing anything about it. In <span class="emphasis"><em>Atlas Shrugged</em></span>, on the other hand, all the characters, including the protagonist - <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atlas_Shrugged_characters#Dagny_Taggart">Dagny Taggart</a>, and the antagonist - <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Galt">John Galt</a>, are constantly travelling and networking. Like it should be. This is probably because Rand realised, shortly after the publication of <span class="emphasis"><em>The Fountainhead</em></span> that <a class="link" href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20120402080644AAD8FGb">&#8220;Reality to be commanded, must be obeyed&#8221;</a> and that the <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_helps_those_who_help_themselves">gods help those that help themselves</a> and that she should work on publicising herself and her works rather than hope for them to become successful by themselves.

This battle supposedly took place in the ancient near east at the first or second millennium B.C.E. when technology was still primitive. I will paraphrase it here.</p><p>The Israelites and their enemy and tormentor, the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philistines">Philistines</a> schedule a large battle. The Philistines have far superior equipment with armours made out of iron, which the Israelites don't have. Goliath, a tall Philistine giant covered in heavy iron armour, with a shield bearer, who carried a big and heavy iron shield to protect him, steps forward and asks for an Israelite man worthy enough to fight him and determine the fate of the battle. Note that in the ancient Near East, the verdicts of battles were commonly determined in such a way. The Israelites fear they will lose the battle.</p><p>Out of nowhere, a young Israelite boy, whom hardly anyone knew about, steps forward with a <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_%28weapon%29">sling</a> and a few pebbles. Goliath thinks this is ridiculous and ridicules him. However, the boy quickly puts a pebble in his sling, and after rotating the sling to achieve a very large velocity (not unusual with slings), hurls it with great accuracy into Goliath's face. (Also not unusual, because shepherds in the Near East effectively used slings to kill lions and other predators to their flock). Goliath&#8217;s face was uncovered to allow him to see so the pebble could hit his forehead. Even if Goliath's shield bearer wanted, he could not have lifted the huge shield in time, and Goliath was completely unagile in his suit and armour. The pebble smashes Goliath&#8217;s brain, and he falls to the ground dead. The Israelites have won the battle.</p><p>The Boy's name was David.</p><p>Why do I think it's important here? Because David was a hacker (see <a class="link" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gba.html">Paul Graham&#8217;s essay &#8220;The Word &#8216;Hacker&#8217;&#8221;</a> for a definition of the terms). He knew the rules, and played by them, but knew how to bend them, in order to earn his victory. If David had fought Goliath using a spear or a sword, he would have lost, but using the sling was a useful workaround.</p><p>There were many other hackers since, and there are a lot of them today even if some of them think that &#8220;hackers&#8221; only mean no good-nick and malevolent computer intruders. Hackers come in all shapes and sizes - and, while a lot of them are male, many of them (including Ayn Rand and Jennifer Lawrence) were or are female.</p><p>And here&#8217;s the thing: this is what an action hero is all about: he makes his own rules, or he even breaks them, and does not accept his fate. This is whereas a tragic hero is bound by many invisible rules, and accepts his fate, which is, almost certainly going to be death.</p><p>And in real life, you should also aim to be a hacker or an action hero, or the many phrases this phenomenon used to be called.</p><p>Was David an Israelite and Goliath a Philistine? Did the battle actually happen in its form? What really happened to David next? That is hard to know, because in a true <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open source</a> fashion, the peoples of the Near East gladly borrowed legends and memes from other people and improved them, or adapted them to their whims. This is similar to how we now create fan fiction by the droves. (Only now it's in much greater speed and capacity.) Moreover, in a way, the tale of David and Goliath is obscured by the mentality of the times, and its context within the larger Biblical epic.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="machines_that_can_give_questions" class="title">The Machines That Can Give You Questions</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/machines_that_can_give_questions.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>Back when <a class="link" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Pablo_Picasso">Pablo Picasso</a> was asked for commenting about computers, he said &#8220;But they are useless.

The early popular Internet around the late 90s, with the so-called <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_1.0">&#8220;Web 1.0&#8221;</a> was a hodgepodge of static web sites (often at GeoCities), lots of useless or incomplete information, search engines that were still not very good, and naturally, lots of fan pages of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buffy_the_Vampire_Slayer_%28TV_series%29">Buffy</a>, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Michelle_Gellar">Sarah Michelle Gellar</a> (whom I can retrospectively tell was the Alpha Female of the time), and other contemporary trends such as <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter">Harry Potter</a> or <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friends">the <span class="emphasis"><em>Friends</em></span> Television series</a></p><p>If you wanted an interactive many-to-many discussion, you had to use Usenet, or mailing lists, or Internet Relay Chat (IRC), or Slashdot, or whatever.</p><p>That has changed significantly, with the fact that the browser scripting language <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> matured, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wikis</a> (= world-editable sites, such as the Wikipedia), web forums and blogs became popular, and search engines (most notably <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Search">Google Web Search</a>) became better.

However, I am sure this is not the only battle that Chuck Norris has lost. This is because we all had many disappointments in our lives: things that didn't work like we wanted to; people we liked or even loved that hated us, moved out of our reach, or died; and finally - opinions we held or proclaimed that turned out to be mistaken. Chuck Norris had those too. These lost battles are part of who we are as human beings and a natural part of life on Earth.</p><p>That put aside, Chuck Norris recently lost a much bigger battle than the one with Bruce Lee, because the seemingly silly and popular Internet meme, the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Norris_facts">Chuck Norris facts</a> (and other memes that they span) have become a much bigger and better fighting machine than he has ever have been. Only it is not a physical war - it is a gentle and subversive (but equally as powerful) psychological war.

I recall <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/fortunes/show.cgi?id=chuck-norris-and-perl-6">this conversation on Freenode&#8217;s #perl</a> in June 2006, shortly after <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randal_L._Schwartz">Randal L.

God did not like him. So what did he do? He let a fly enter the emperor's head and keep buzzing there. The emperor could not stand the fly buzzing in his head, and ended up being driven to insanity, and then committing suicide. So his <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubris">Hubris</a> (= excessive human pride) caused him to be killed by a creature as insignificant as a fly.</p><p>While this is a folk tale, it illustrates the fact that we as humans are still at the mercy of forces beyond us.

I am almost certain the Linux kernel development, and the open source world in general will survive this shock, but a wonderful and beautiful life will be lost forever. I can also get hit by a motorcar, and so can Chuck Norris, who may now be old enough to have a heart attack or any other deteriorating health problems due to old age. We are all fragile, and must realize we should not succumb to Hubris, because even if God does not exist, then Hubris will make us undertake some really stupid actions, which will end up causing our downfall.</p><p>Moreover, as surprising as it sounds, God also has a master: logic. Aristotle codified <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Term_logic">Term Logic</a> in his <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organon">Organon</a>, which back then was likely not so taken for granted:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>A is A, and A is not not-A? Of course A can be not-A.

Perhaps the most famous is &#8220;Can God create a stone so heavy that he would be unable to lift ?&#8221;. However, a more recent, and also important, one is <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem">the Halting problem</a>, which specifies that one cannot write a program which will: <span class="bold"><strong>1.</strong></span> finish within a finite time, and &#8212; <span class="bold"><strong>2.</strong></span> will determine if any other arbitrary program will terminate (or alternatively run forever).</p><p>While the formal proof is complex, there is a short and informal proof that most intelligent people can understand.</p><p>So the King of the Kings of the Kings, as mighty and wonderful as they may be, also has a master - logic.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="tie_your_camel" class="title">&#8220;Put your faith in Allah, but tie your camel&#8221;</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/tie_your_camel.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>The tale (a Hadith) tells that Muhammad saw a shepherd going to pray, while keeping his Camel untied.

So Muhammad told him, and I paraphrase: &#8220;Dude, it doesn't work that way! Camels can escape due to nature&#8217;s whims. So: put your faith in Allah, but, for the love of God - tie your Camel.&#8221; (I am an Israeli, agnostic, non-religious, Jew but I think I can borrow useful memes from Islam, or whatever, if I think they have merit, right?

And here's the thing: this is what an <span class="bold"><strong>Action Hero</strong></span> is all about - he defies the rules, bends the rules, and eventually wins. A tragic hero on the other hand is bounded by many invisible rules, accept his fate, and cannot win. So Action is the exact opposite of Tragedy. (And to truly see why this is true, you should watch and listen to the 1m43s-long <a class="link" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Z9Ismh1elM">trailer for Shakespeare&#8217;s Hamlet starring Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> from the excellent film <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Action_Hero"><span class="emphasis"><em>Last Action Hero</em></span></a>.) I also guarantee you that this very essay is not perfect, and that&#8217;s OK, because I&#8217;m a hacker and like to bend the rules, and while I care about quality, I also care about getting something - anything - out of the door quickly. With the help of editors, I can always fix the essay later, in case a prestigious publication such as Time Magazine or Playboy would want to publish it, but if I wait until it is letter-perfect before I publish and announce it, then it will be a big waste of time.</p><p>I also realised that even though I placed my <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">stories and screenplays</a> under the <code class="code">/humour/</code> section of my homepage, they were also almost always also stories of action. Many action films now contain a lot of humour, and humour films and even dramas are often action films in disguise (and that includes <span class="emphasis"><em>Silver Linings Playbook</em></span>). Many people complained that each and every popular Hollywood film now contains a mixture of action, love and sex, humour, drama, and naturally - a happy ending. However, my stories also have all that, and during writing them, I wasn&#8217;t trying to make their &#8220;ratings&#8221; higher - just to write what was on my mind, and to make the story as fun as possible. And as surprisingly as it sounds, some of the most ancient myths (e.g: the stories in the Hebrew Bible, or those of the Greek mythology) also contained all that in their own old, and now antiquated, way.</p><p>Many people will think I&#8217;m being blasphemous by paraphrasing the story of David and Goliath, or the Hadith about Muhammad, and spicing them up a little, but the thing is &#8212; it makes these stories something alive and dynamic because our times are different. Shakespeare&#8217;s plays were narrated as they were during his times, but reading them now is boring.

The United States has an unnatural obsession with <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient">IQ</a>, which is not a good measurement for intelligence (for many reasons), but the point is that they are intelligent and competent.</p><p>And what is the recipe for such intelligence and competence? The answer is having a mostly happy childhood, being open-minded and knowledgeable about all sorts of small things, getting a lot of information, knowledge, understanding, and insights, and being a whole rounded person. The world&#8217;s greatest warriors such as Chuck Norris or Bruce Lee were not overly muscular, and Chuck Norris had a happy and supposedly uneventful childhood. He also was aware that he has to stand for himself, and take decisive action (&#8220;The gods help them that help themselves&#8221;) instead of letting life lead him in its own way ("Go with the flow" or "Be a product of your environment").

Why Alexandria? Because it was a port city and close to the sea. It is well known that many of the peoples of the Near East lived by and loved the sea , such as the Greek, and the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenicia">Phoenicians</a> (which the Israelites referred to as <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canaan">Canaan</a>). The Israelites (who are now the Jews) started as a kind of sub-culture and fashion on Canaan (and archaeologists witness a transition in Palestine and other parts of the Levant from the Canaanite period to the Israelite period). However, they later on were heavily influenced by both the Phoenicians and the Greek, by culture, ideals and even by blood.

Yet, openness is also mostly a synonym for such things as &#8220;honesty&#8221; and &#8220;sincerity&#8221;: not lying, being direct, and not hiding things. It also means not playing games with people and being happy for their happiness and success, rather than being consumed with jealousy or (God help me) envy (which means you wish to destroy these values, rather than coveting them for your own).</p><p>So why is it important? Because you should be honest in everything you do. Do you like a member-of-the-appropriate-sex (MOTAS) that already is in a relationship? Admit it to him or her, but be happy for them, and tell them you can be on the rebound or if they have any friends who are looking for a significant other. That put aside even the most noble gentlemen (and ladies) and those that are happily married and possibly even have children, are allowed to flirt with other MOTAS.</p><p>Did your friend, spouse, a celebrity of some sort, or a complete stranger you heard of, who seems nice, get a good opportunity?

Mazal Tov on Chen and yours marriage. It reminds me of a quote from Charlotte Bronte&#8217;s Jane Eyre:</p><p>&#8220;At this period she married, removed with her husband (a clergyman, an excellent man, <span class="bold"><strong>almost worthy of such a wife</strong></span>) to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.&#8221;</p><p>Well, in your case I can say that <span class="bold"><strong>both of you are almost worthy of each other</strong></span>. Congrats again!</p></blockquote></div><p>As much as I was attracted to Chen (and she likes a lot of the stuff I created too), I didn&#8217;t try to break their relationship, and have her for myself, and wished them happiness. And I did it, because I knew there were plenty of wonderful female hackers (including those that are still not very good at computers, or even hate them) and I can eventually find a good one of my own. And I also knew that coming between Chen and Omer, will make both of them unhappy, and that's not what I want.</p><p>People may appear to not appreciate you being sincere with them, but believe me, that it will pay in spades later on, also because you'll feel better about yourself, and be happier, more peaceful, and more competent.</p><p>The same thing applies to jobs and work. You shouldn't lie on your job interview. Is the company developing in Java and you don't like Java a lot? Admit it. Say that you prefer not to work long hours because people are <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erin_Hoffman">more productive working during sane hours</a>. If you contribute to the Wikipedia or to open source software, admit it, because workplaces that dislike such things about their employees, will likely not be places you'd like to work with. And yes, it means that you should be able to freely talk and admit everything about you (that you are an Israeli, a Jew, a Black person, a Catholic, a Muslim, straight, gay, anti-religious, homophobic, or whatever) instead of the silly laws that try to prevent discrimination and wish to &#8220;streamline&#8221; the interview while deliberately going against the liberty of speech.</p><p>Fact of the matter is, you are allowed to discriminate, even in accepting positions. I did not get many jobs despite feeling that I have done extremely well on the Interviews, yet I would not dream of suing the workplace for not accepting me. I accepted whatever reasons they had for deciding against me. Furthermore, sometimes I was fired or laid off based on various reasons, and I also accepted my fate and moved on, because working for a certain workplace was not something I was entitled to &#8212; it was a privilege.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="seize_opportunities" class="title">The Importance of Seizing Opportunities</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/seize_opportunities.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>A good hacker knows better than to create imaginary problems.

The first is that he decided to depart before his death, due to bad health, which I believe is an admission that <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethical_egoism">Ethical egoism</a> has some merit, and that if he will continue to serve despite his health problems, it will be bad, not only for him, but for the Catholic church as well, because his bad health will prevent him to function properly as a pope and a leader.</p><p>But the more important anecdote about the departing pope, is the fact that he opened a <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter">Twitter</a> account which made many people laugh, because Twitter and similar forms of text-based communication mediums such as Facebook or Google Plus were then held in much contempt. But should they?</p><p>Throughout history, there has been a trend towards communication mediums that were quicker to write (had easier &#8220;on-ramps&#8221;) and yet produced results that were of lesser quality. Back when the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alphabet">Alphabet</a> was created for <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phoenician_language">the Phoenician language</a>, and later on adopted in various variations by languages of close proximity, including Greek, Aramaic, and Hebrew (which started as a dialect of the proper Canaanite language), it seemed like a poor man and low-culture glyph system, that was used and abused for writing about some really low-life topics: drinking, being happy and jolly, spreading vicious rumours, erotica, depictions of violence, silly jokes, and even blatant descriptions of incest.</p><p>( If you don't believe me, then read <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hebrew_Bible">the Jewish Bible (= the Tanakh)</a> with a critical eye, and you&#8217;ll find all those things there and more. )</p><p>Some people were probably hoping that it will be a fad, and that Cuneiform will be used for years to come.</p><p>The same thing repeated itself thousands of years later with the Print, which as we know helped bring the Renaissance, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protestant_Reformation">the Protestant Reformation</a>, the end of the Earth-centred theories of the universe, and many other subsequent changes, including the fact that you now read these words, which were originally published on a web site. The Roman Catholic church has survived this change, but it is now very different than it was back when Gutenberg invented the print.</p><p>So: Cuneiform &#8594; Alphabet &#8594; The Printing Press &#8594; Early typesetting systems &#8594; Word Processors &#8594; Early HTML/Web 1.0 &#8594; blogs/wikis &#8594; &#8220;Social networks&#8221; such as Twitter, Facebook or Google Plus (which were inspired by the unadorned text that people have been writing in text-based Usenet posts and E-mail messages). Will the Roman Catholic Church survive in the &#8220;Twitter age&#8221;? Hard to tell, but Pope Benedict XVI understood that it should embrace such social networks and recent trends, if it intended to make the best of the situation. And since then, social networks have only become more mainstream.</p><p>We can see similar progressions in other forms of media (e.g: Comics &#8594; Web comics &#8594; Captioned images (e.g: lolcats)). All that put aside, newer media does not completely eliminate the need for an older one, and while cuneiform is no longer usable, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofer">Jewish scribes (Sofrey SeTam)</a> still write some religious manuscripts by hand, very slowly (and costly), because their quality cannot be high enough.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is important to embrace such technological changes, and this understanding is one thing I will always be grateful for the departing pope.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="empowering_youth" class="title">How Technology is Empowering Youth</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/empowering_youth.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>During the Middle Ages, the apprentices of craftsmen graduated to become masters, and started their own shops, at a much younger age than 18.

( Previously, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marlee_Matlin">Marlee Matlin</a> won it when she was 21 years old, back in 1986, but it was an isolated case. ). I anticipate, and hope, that Lawrence&#8217;s winning will bring forth an age where some even younger film makers, receive the Academy Awards. Perhaps as young as being 10 years old - perhaps younger.</p><p>The Internet and other modern technologies empower many other previously encumbered sections of the population aside from people of certain ages, but it's high time we recognise, that we enter a world where young people are more empowered.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="learned_from_rpgs" class="title">What I Learned from Role Playing Games</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/learned_from_rpgs.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>I used to play <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabletop_role-playing_game">Tabletop role-playing games</a> such as Dungeons &amp; Dragons during the 8th and 9th grade until I quit, and it provided some important insights for me about real-life.

The time one spends writing an essay, a blog post or a story, will enhance their writing skills, and their personal philosophy, and will make it easier for them to write more in the future. The time invested cooking will make one a better cook, and will make it easier to cook in the future.</p><p>The more time we invest in honing a certain skill, the easier it is to become better and better in it.</p><p>One complication to all that is the sad phenomenon of <a class="link" href="http://shlomif.livejournal.com/44643.html">&#8220;Psyche Death&#8221; or &#8220;Growth Death&#8221;</a> where a person become more and more cynical and their mind deteriorates, while he continues to be alive.

The most viable belief systems are those that can reach out and incorporate new ideas, new memes, new metaphors, new interfaces, new extensions, new ways of doing things. My goal this year is to try to get Perl to reach out and cooperate with Java. I know it may be difficult for some of you to swallow, but Java is not the enemy. Nor is Lisp, or Python, or Tcl. That is not to say that these languages don't have good and bad points. I am not a cultural relativist. Nor am I a linguistic relativist.

It is important for an idea system not to stagnate and accept external influences with different, better, and/or newer ideas.</p><p>Several idea systems made the mistake of thinking they were the &#8220;final word&#8221; or the &#8220;omega&#8221;. Jesus claimed to have been the last prophet, and so did Muhammad (despite the fact that Jesus did that too). If you ask me, the only difference between idea systems that are still considered holy, and idea systems that are no longer taken as gospel (including those that were fictional to begin with) is simply that: they are held as holy, and thought to be the final word.</p><p>Some people criticized me for not staying true to my Jewish roots and instead incorporating more recent elements in <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/stories/">my stories</a>, but it is indicative of a healthy and inquiring mind, who still seeks a bigger and better Truth. Part of God&#8217;s Truth.</p><p>Furthermore, as Neo-Tech notes, the word &#8220;Truth&#8221; denotes a static assertion and people constantly dispute its meaning, and the word &#8220;honesty&#8221; is indicative of an active and dynamic process for better perceiving reality.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h3 id="publish_or_perish" class="title">&#8220;Publish or Perish&#8221;</h3><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/publish_or_perish.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>There is an old adage about the Academic life that reads: <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish">&#8220;Publish or Perish&#8221;</a>.
