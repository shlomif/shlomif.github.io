I was quick to dismiss her due to previously playing in the dystopian <i>The Hunger Games</i> (I dislike dystopian stuff) but I loved her on <i>Silver Linings Playbook</i>. Although attractive, Ms. Lawrence is certainly not the most beautiful woman I ever saw, and I'm sure she has some personality quirks (like we all do), but thanks to playing her card rights, she is now a much coveted <b>Alpha Female</b>, who can have the rest of her life (and I wish her a very happy and long life) go in a direction she chooses.</p></div></body></html>
