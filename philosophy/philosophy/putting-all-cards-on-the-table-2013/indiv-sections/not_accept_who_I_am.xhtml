Geeks and hackers come in all shapes and sizes, and there is no need to try to fit better among fellow computer hackers, just due to <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html">the portrait of J. Random Hacker</a> in the Jargon file. I do not mind people who deviate from my preferences in some or all respects, but no two people (including no two identical twins) are alike. You should accept who you are too.</p></div></body></html>
