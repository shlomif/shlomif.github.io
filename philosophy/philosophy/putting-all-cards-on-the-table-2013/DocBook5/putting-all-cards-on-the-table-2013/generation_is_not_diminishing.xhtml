Nowadays, many kids are bound to do things that will make some of us as grown-ups think that “the generation is diminishing” but naturally, this is folly (see <a class="link" href="http://www.robcottingham.ca/cartoon/archive/this-brain-this-brain-fire/">the Noise to Signal’s “Fire” cartoon and the comments about it</a>), and is just indicative that you are growing more cynical.</p><p>As a matter of fact, newer generations can build on the work, knowledge, and wisdom of older generations (“Standing on the shoulders of giants”) and achieve dazzling new heights. During <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hellenistic_period">Hellenistic times</a>, many people probably believed that philosophy was a useless mind exercise, that philosophers were contaminating the youth, and that they were parasites who make problems where none exist. Philosophy at the time was considered a form of cheap entertainment, and philosophers were treated with the same amount of contempt as actors, comedians and models are today.</p><p>That was all well and nice, until the Romans had a very hard time and suffered many casualties, while conquering the island of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedes">Archimedes</a> due to the many devices and inventions which he came up with, and which were utilised to protect it.</p><p>The author of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecclesiastes">Ecclesiastes</a>, wrote in <a class="link" href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/bib/poly/ecc007.htm">Eccelsiastes 7:10</a> that “Don’t say ‘What happened to make the earlier days better than these,’ for you ask this not in wisdom.” and that was written around 300 B.C.</p></section><footer><div class="navfooter"><hr/><table style="width:100%"><tr><td style="width:40%;text-align:left"><a accesskey="p" href="best_warriors.xhtml">Prev</a> </td><td style="width:20%;text-align:center"> </td><td style="width:40%;text-align:right"> <a accesskey="n" href="new_alexandrias.xhtml">Next</a></td></tr><tr><td style="width:40%;text-align:left;vertical-align:top">Hackers Make the Best Warriors </td><td style="width:20%;text-align:center"><a accesskey="h" href="index.xhtml">Home</a></td><td style="width:40%;text-align:right;vertical-align:top"> The New Alexandrias</td></tr></table></div></footer></body></html>
