However, stealing involves taking tangible property without permission, and depriving the owner of one less instance of it. On the other hand, with a public work, we can make an unlimited number of copies, while not harming the original, and while respecting the exclusive rights of the author for his work. This is because we just copy it - we don&#8217;t claim it is ours.</p><p>Accusing people who share or duplicate media non-commercially of &#8220;stealing&#8221; obscures two other forms of media-related crimes that are in fact stealing:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>If someone has somehow gained access to my private files and used it to prepare his own copies (or worse delete the originals), then he has performed stealing.

Sites or services that point to where to download the content are just referencing the presence of the information. Referencing or linking is <span class="bold"><strong>never</strong></span> a crime. It&#8217;s like instructions on actions like how to prepare bombs, where to find illegal drugs, how to cheat various systems, or where to find stolen goods. By itself this information is not a crime to know, because it&#8217;s protected speech. So does pointing to a copyrighted resource.</p><p>So now we&#8217;re left with the question whether sharing a copyrighted work (or downloading it) is an objectively criminal action. The answer is again &#8220;no&#8221;. It&#8217;s not a crime since the originator of a copyrighted work that was made public cannot prevent non-commercial copies from being made and distributed. As of today, many countries passed such laws, but these laws are unethical. Sharing of copyrighted work is common-place, and many of the people who do it (including many children) do not feel they&#8217;re doing something wrong, or feel guilty about it. So it is ethical, and moral and should be legal.</p><p>Note that selling copies commercially (as in stores of pirated media), can be prohibited by the copyright holder. But non-commercial copying (from friend to friend, or via Peer-to-Peer services) cannot.</p><p>Several respondents to early versions of this article, claimed that I should <span class="bold"><strong>prove</strong></span> that copying or receiving a copy of an artwork that was released to the public is ethical and moral. Well, I&#8217;d like to ask those critics &#8220;Why it is not moral?&#8221;. And they&#8217;ll probably have no answer.</p><p>According to <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/obj-oss/obj-oss/two_levels_of_morality.html">the definition of Ethics and Morality that I accept</a> (presented there as &#8220;Constitutionality and Beneficiality&#8221;), then file sharing is ethical, because it does not involve an initiatory force, threat of force or fraud against one&#8217;s property, which as I demonstrated here does not include the so-called &#8220;intellectual property&#8221;. Moreover, it is also moral or at least not immoral, because it does not harm or prevent the filling of human biological needs.</p><p>Copyrights are not an absolute &#8220;nature-given&#8221; right like the rights for life and freedom. Instead, they are a state-enacted monopoly that is meant to protect the originators of artworks from abuse by commercial distributors. However, due to the computers and Internet revolutions, it makes no sense to try and prevent non-commercial digital distribution of them.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="why_should_be_legal_other_ways_to_make_money" class="title">There are other ways to make money</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/why_should_be_legal_other_ways_to_make_money.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>There are many other ways in which originators of media can make money even if they allow free distribution.

Recently <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_Term_Extension_Act">the Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act</a> that was passed in American congress extended the copyrights act by 20 years. One should note that the term was already extended several times in the past, since the first American copyrights law. 95 years for a copyrights of works of corporations is far too long, and we also risk that copyrights will be extended indefinitely this way. (&#8220;Forever minus a day&#8221;)</p><p>A different issue is the <a class="link" href="http://www.anti-dmca.org/">Digital Millennium Copyright Act</a> (or DMCA for short). This law that was passed in the 90&#8217;s criminalises a lot of valid activity. It prohibits the writing of &#8220;circumvention devices&#8221; to bypass copyright protection (and some say every computer security measure, in general). It is actively used to threaten to remove allegedly copyrighted content from web sites, because they may violate it. (See <a class="link" href="http://www.boingboing.net/2004/11/06/save_canadas_interne.html">Cory Doctorow&#8217;s excellent essay &#8220;Save Canada&#8217;s Internet from WIPO&#8221;</a>.) It also contains a lot of other damaging clauses.</p><p>The <a class="link" href="http://www.fepproject.org/">Free Expression Policy Project</a> has an excellent <a class="link" href="http://www.fepproject.org/policyreports/copyright2dvalves.html">report on the various issues in copyrights law in the past and today</a>. It is a very recommended read.</p><p>A different issue is that of the so-called <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management">&#8220;Digital Restrictions Management&#8221; measures (or DRM for short)</a>, which are measures meant to prevent the copying or ripping of digital media.
