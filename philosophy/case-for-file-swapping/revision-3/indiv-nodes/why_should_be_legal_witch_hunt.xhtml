From suing a female 12-years-old honour student, to a grandpa in his 70&#8217;s, to a college player of American Football. They also were closing many online sites. In New Delhi the police gave the media companies an unlimited warrant to raid the houses of people suspected of media sharing.</p><p>Lots and lots of &#8220;1984&#8221;-style terror. And for what? For preventing the supposed loss of sales by a limited private sector of the industry? For preventing a practically costless operation of distributing an mp3 that can be done by the &#8220;criminals&#8221; at the comfort of their homes?</p><p>In a presentation he gave, Richard M. Stallman (of the Free Software Foundation and GNU project fame) gave another good reason why it wasn&#8217;t unacceptable. He said that when he was a kid in school, his teacher asked the children to share their sweets with the other children. And now, suddenly they have to tell them something like &#8220;No, Tommy, don&#8217;t share your music/software/videos/etc. It&#8217;s illegal!&#8221;.</p><p>What&#8217;s a child to feel in this case? Sharing is a nice part of living in a friendly society, and there&#8217;s no reason we should prevent it, or else we ourselves will become more and more selfish.</p></section></main>
