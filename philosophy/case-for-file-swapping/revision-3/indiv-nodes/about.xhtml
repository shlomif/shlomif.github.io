He is a user, developer, advocate and activist of Open Source Software. His greatest contribution so far in this regard has been <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a>, a Public Domain Library for solving games of Freecell and other types of Solitaire. However, he also <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/">initiated several other projects</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/contributions/">made important contributions to projects he did not initiate</a> some of them very large scale.</p><p>Otherwise, Fish has written <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/humour/">several humorous novellas, stories and aphorisms</a>, which he has released online, under the CC-by or CC-by-sa licenses. He also wrote <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/">many essays and articles</a> as well as <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/lecture/">material for presentations</a> which (unless specified otherwise) were released under the CC-by license.</p><p>To conclude, if you think that &#8220;this guy attacks Intellectual Property so he obviously doesn&#8217;t have any significant IP of his own&#8221;, then this myth, in his case, cannot be farther from the fact.</p><p>Shlomi Fish is a Jew and an Israeli by nationality, an atheist by faith (or lack of it) and a <a class="link" href="http://www.neo-tech.com/neotech/advantages/">Neo-Tech</a> Objectivist by ideology. As such he is a firm believer in both individual rights and freedoms, and freedom from oppression, as well as a free economy (Laissez-Faire Capitalism) that is free of government intervention. He also does his best efforts to live by the values of honesty, integrity, individualism, independent thought, passion, and rational self-growth.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="about_links" class="title">More Links</h4></header><p><a class="link" href="http://www.advogato.org/article/841.html">&#8220;Acting against anti-File-Swapping Lawsuits in Israel&#8221;</a> was an early attempt to convey this message written by me.
