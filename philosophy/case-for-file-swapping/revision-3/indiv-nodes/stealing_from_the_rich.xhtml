Secondly, it&#8217;s not really true in this case.</p><p>Copying a copyrighted work is not stealing, because the money that the author can charge for its commercial copying is due to copyright law - a civil (not criminal) contract between the State and the artists, in order to encourage original creation. However, <a class="link" href="../#term_stealing_theft" title="&#8220;Stealing&#8221; or &#8220;Theft&#8221;">breaking this contract is not stealing</a>.</p><p>It should be understood that record labels and other distributors of entertainment and non-technical media should either adapt to the new situation where Internet users can download such files for free and enjoy them, and to a greater extent contribute such media on their own, without much help from them, or simply perish as a no longer necessary establishment, that just gets in the way.</p><p>This is not about stealing from the rich and giving to the poor. This is about cutting down the middle man.</p></section></main>
