How many times have you seen web-sites of software that claim that the new version of the program (or even the first) is currently under work, will change the world, but is not available yet? How many times have you heard of web-sites that are not live yet, and refuse to tell people exactly what they are about?</p><p>Alternatively, in the case of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverity">the &#8220;Stanford checker&#8221;</a>, which is a sophisticated tool for static code analysis, it is not available for download, but instead is a service provided by its parent company.</p><p>A program should be available in the wild somehow (for downloading or at least buying) so people can use it, play with it, become impressed or unimpressed, report bugs, and ask for new features. Otherwise it&#8217;s just in-house software or at most a service, that is not adequate for most needs.</p><p>In the &#8220;Cathedral and the Bazaar&#8221;, Eric Raymond recommends <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s04.html">to &#8220;release early and release often&#8221;</a>. Make frequent, incremental releases, so your project won&#8217;t stagnate. If you take your project and work on it yourself for too long, people will give up.</p><p>If you have a new idea for a program, make sure you implement some basic but adequate functionality, and then release it so people can play with it, and learn about it. Most successful open-source projects, that have been open-source since their inception, have started this way: the Linux kernel, gcc, vim, perl, CPython. If you look at the earliest versions of all of them, you&#8217;ll find that they were very limited if not downright hideous, but now they are often among the best of breed.</p></section></main>
