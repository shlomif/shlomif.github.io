I am active in the <a class="link" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/">fc-solve-discuss mailing list</a>, which is dedicated to computerised techniques for solving <a class="link" href="http://www.freecell.org/">the Freecell solitaire card game</a>, and for discussing other automated solving and research of Solitaire games. This mailing list was started after I wrote <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> (with a lowercase &#8220;c&#8221; and an uppercase &#8220;S&#8221;), an open-source solver, which has proven to be quite popular. However, the mailing list was not restricted to discussing it exclusively, and was joined by many other Freecell solving experts, researchers and enthusiasts.</p><p>Recently, Gary Campbell wrote <a class="link" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/741">this message</a> reading:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I think the solver discussion in the Wikipedia should mention that the FCPro solvers give quite lengthy and virtually unusable solutions. No human wants to follow the several hundred steps that usually result in order to get at what&#8217;s really required to solve a given layout. If someone wants a solution that can be understood, they want one that is under 100 steps. This is a major contribution and it should be stated. There are a lot of <span class="bold"><strong>&#8220;toy&#8221;</strong></span> solvers and only a very few of <span class="bold"><strong>&#8220;industrial strength.&#8221;</strong></span> One of the latter is the solver by Danny Jones. I don&#8217;t see that on your list. The results he has gotten from his solver pretty much put your solver to shame. The more you hype Freecell Solver, the more criticism you open yourself up to.</p></blockquote></div><p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard for me to determine what &#8220;industrial strength&#8221;, &#8220;enterprise grade&#8221; and other such buzzwords are. But I&#8217;ll try to define high quality here, and try to show when a program is high quality.</p></section></main>
