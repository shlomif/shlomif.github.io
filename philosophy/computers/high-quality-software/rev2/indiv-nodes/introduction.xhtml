Low-quality software applications will require the users or end-developers to work around their bugs and limitations, write a lot of extra functionality themselves, and as a result, duplicate a lot of effort and cause a lot of frustration and unhappiness. This is assuming they don&#8217;t give up on it soon or right away, and end up looking for something else.</p><p>But what makes a popular software application &#8220;high-quality&#8221;? A high-quality program or library can be defined as one that is usable as is, that causes very few frustrations, and that requires little if any modifications or workarounds to get it up-to-speed.</p><p>I&#8217;m not talking about the application that&#8217;s the most hyped, or the fastest, most featureful, or best. Sometimes you can often hear endless rants and <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)</a> attacks about it. Often, it has competing programs that are superior in many respects.</p><p>In this essay we&#8217;ll look at what quality metrics apply to software.</p><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="motivation" class="title">Motivation</h4></header><p>How did it occur to me to ponder this question? I am active in the <a class="link" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/">fc-solve-discuss mailing list</a>, which is dedicated to computerised techniques for solving <a class="link" href="http://www.freecell.org/">the Freecell solitaire card game</a>, and for discussing other automated solving and research of Solitaire games. This mailing list was started after I wrote <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> (with a lowercase &#8220;c&#8221; and an uppercase &#8220;S&#8221;), an open-source solver, which has proven to be quite popular. However, the mailing list was not restricted to discussing it exclusively, and was joined by many other Freecell solving experts, researchers and enthusiasts.</p><p>Recently, Gary Campbell wrote <a class="link" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/741">this message</a> reading:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I think the solver discussion in the Wikipedia should mention that the FCPro solvers give quite lengthy and virtually unusable solutions. No human wants to follow the several hundred steps that usually result in order to get at what&#8217;s really required to solve a given layout. If someone wants a solution that can be understood, they want one that is under 100 steps. This is a major contribution and it should be stated. There are a lot of <span class="bold"><strong>&#8220;toy&#8221;</strong></span> solvers and only a very few of <span class="bold"><strong>&#8220;industrial strength.&#8221;</strong></span> One of the latter is the solver by Danny Jones. I don&#8217;t see that on your list. The results he has gotten from his solver pretty much put your solver to shame. The more you hype Freecell Solver, the more criticism you open yourself up to.</p></blockquote></div><p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard for me to determine what &#8220;industrial strength&#8221;, &#8220;enterprise grade&#8221; and other such buzzwords are. But I&#8217;ll try to define high quality here, and try to show when a program is high quality.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="organisation" class="title">Organisation of this Document</h4></header><p>I initially <span class="bold"><strong>wanted to give some examples</strong></span> for open-source software that I considered to be of exceptional high-quality, but I decided against it.</p><p>That&#8217;s because their exceptional quality is a matter of taste, and it may provoke too much criticism against this essay as a whole. Thus, I&#8217;ll just give some examples, possibly accompanied by screenshots, of places where one program does something better than a different program. That does not imply that the latter is in fact of lower-quality than the former, in all possible respects.</p><p>This article is written from my point-of-view as a developer of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open_source_software">&#8220;Free and Open Source Software&#8221;</a>, and will focus on open-source and pseudo-open-source software. However, a lot of what I say is more universal.</p></section></section></main>
