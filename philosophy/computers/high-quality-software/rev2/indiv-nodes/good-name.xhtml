One example for a project with an awful name is <a class="link" href="http://www.march-hare.com/cvspro/">CVSNT</a>. There are two problems with the name:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>It is based on CVS, which most people have ran into its limitations, is considered pass&#233; and unloved, and people would rather avoid.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The &#8220;NT&#8221; part implies it only runs on Windows-NT, which is both misleading and undesirable.</p></li></ol></div><p>On the other hand, the competing project &#8220;Subversion&#8221; has a much better name, since it has nothing to do with CVS, or Windows NT, and since it is an English word and sounds cool.</p><p>Some projects are successful despite being badly named, while some have a very cool name, but languish. Still, a good name helps a lot.</p><p>Also consider what <a class="link" href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.unix.pc-clone.32bit/msg/80bb74847934edc7">Linus Torvalds said about Linux and 386BSD</a> (half jokingly):</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>No. That&#8217;s it. The cool name, that is. We worked very hard on creating a name that would appeal to the majority of people, and it certainly paid off: thousands of people are using linux just to be able to say &#8220;OS/2? Hah. I&#8217;ve got Linux. What a cool name&#8221;. 386BSD made the mistake of putting a lot of numbers and weird abbreviations into the name, and is scaring away a lot of people just because it sounds too technical.</p></blockquote></div></section></main>
