Many people will usually not take a look at it otherwise, for many reasons, some ideological but some also practical. <a href="../#ftn.ideology" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[Ideology]</sup></a> Without the source, and without it being under a proper licence, the software will not become part of most distributions of Linux, the BSD operating systems, etc.</p><p>If you just say that your software &#8220;is copyright by John Doe. All Rights Reserved&#8221;, then it may arguably induce an inability to study its internals (including to fix bugs or add features) without being restricted by a non-compete clause, or even that its use or re-distribution is restricted. Some software ship with extremely long, complicated (and often not entirely enforceable) End-User-Licence-Agreements (EULAs) that no-one reads or cares to understand.</p><p id="public-domain-source">As a result, many people will find a program with a licence that is not 100% <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free and Open Source Software</a> - unacceptable. To be truly useful the application also needs be <a class="link" href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">GPL compatible</a>, and naturally usable public-domain licences such as the modified BSD licence, the MIT X11 licence, or even pure Public Domain source code<a href="../#ftn.public-domain-source" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[public-domain]</sup></a>, are even better for their ability to be sub-licensed and re-used. This is while licenses that allow incorporation but not sub-licensing, like the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) are somewhere in between.</p><p>While some programs on Linux have become popular despite being under non-optimal licences, many Linux distributions pride themselves that the core system consists of &#8220;100% free software&#8221;. Most software that became non-open-source, was eventually forked or got into disuse, or else suffered from a lot of bad publicity.</p><p>As a result, a high-quality software has a licence that is the most usable in the context of its common use cases. These licences are doubly-important for freely-distributed UNIX software.</p></section></main>
