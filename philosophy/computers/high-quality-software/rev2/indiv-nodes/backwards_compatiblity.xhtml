Some backward compatibility, like relying on bugs or other misbehaviours (&#8220;bug-to-bug compatibility&#8221;), is probably too extreme to consider. But users would like to upgrade the software and expect all of their programs to just continue to work.</p><p>A bad example for software that does not maintain backwards compatibility is <a class="link" href="http://www.php.net/">PHP</a>, where every primary digit breaks the compatibility with the older one: PHP 4 was not compatible with PHP 3 and PHP 5 was not compatible with PHP 4. Furthermore, sometimes existing user-land code was broken in minor-digit releases. As such, maintaining PHP code into the future is a very costly process, especially if you want it to work with a range of versions.</p><p>On the other hand, the perl5 developers have been maintaining backwards compatibility between 5.000, 5.001, 5.002 up to 5.6.x, 5.8.x and now 5.10.x. Therefore, one can normally expect older scripts to just work. perl5 can also run a lot of Perl 4 code and below, and Perl 4 code can be ported to modern versions of perl5 with relative ease. While sometimes scripts, programs or modules were broken (due to lack of &#8220;bug-to-bug compatibility&#8221;), or became slower, upgrading to a new version of Perl is normally straightforward.</p></section></main>
