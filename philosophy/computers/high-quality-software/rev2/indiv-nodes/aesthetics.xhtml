Aesthetics in this context, does not necessarily mean very &#8220;artsy&#8221; or having a breath-taking style. But we may have run into software (usually one for internal use or one of those very costly, bad-quality, niche, software) that seemed very ugly and badly designed, with a horrible user-interface, etc.</p><p>Different types of applications, and those running on different platforms, have different conventions for what is considered aesthetic. In <a class="link" href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/">The Art of UNIX Programming</a>, Eric Raymond <a class="link" href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/html/ch11s09.html">makes the case for the &#8220;Silence is Golden&#8221; principle of designing UNIX command-line interfaces</a>. Basically, a command line program should output as little as possible. Now observe the behaviour of aptitude (a unified interface for package management) on Ubuntu Gutsy Gibbon, when trying to install a non-existing package name:</p><pre class="programlisting">

        </pre><p>15 lines of output, and only one of them in the middle is the informative one. Why is all this information a concern of mine, especially given the fact that they are all given in the same monotonous default colour.</p><p>On the other hand, here&#8217;s what urpmi (a similar package management interface for Mandriva) says on Mandriva Cooker:</p><pre class="programlisting">

[root@telaviv1 ~]# urpmi this-does-not-exist
No package named this-does-not-exist
[root@telaviv1 ~]#

        </pre><p>Exactly one line and it&#8217;s informative. While aptitude certainly has its merits, its verbosity still makes it much more painful to use than urpmi, when I have to work on Ubuntu.</p><p>Back to more visual aesthetics, one of the reasons that made me want to use Linux more than Windows 95&#8217; or 98&#8217; was the fact that its desktops were truly themable and could be made to look much better without effort. If I got tired of the same look, I could easily switch. While Windows XP shipped with a more attractive theme, and also had some proprietary and non-gratis theming software, Linux supplied all of that out-of-the-box and with a more attractive theme. The <a class="link" href="http://youtube.com/watch?v=xC5uEe5OzNQ">effects supplied by the Linux 3-D desktops</a>, which have put the 9-milliard Dollar effects of Vista to shame, have convinced some people to install Linux on their computer after seeing them.</p></section></main>
