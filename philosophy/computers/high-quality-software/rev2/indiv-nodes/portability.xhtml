However, people are using many platforms on many different CPU architectures: Windows 32-bit/64-bit on Intel machines, Itanium, or x86-64; Linux on a multitude of platforms; BSD systems (NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and others) on many architectures as well; Mac OS X; Sun Solaris (now also OpenSolaris), and more obscure (but still popular) Unix-clones like AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, SCO UNIX, Tru64 (formerly Digital Unix), etc. And to say nothing of more exotic, non-UNIX, non-Microsoft operating systems like Novell Netware, Digital Corp.s&#8217;s VMS or OpenVMS, IBM&#8217;s VM/CMS or OS/390 (MVS), BeOS, AmigaOS, Mac OS 9 or earlier, PalmOS, VxWorks, etc. etc.</p><p id="non-vax-archs">As a general rule, the only thing that runs on top of all of these systems (in the modern &#8220;All the world is a VAX.&#8221; world) is a C-based program or something that is C-hosted. <a href="../#ftn.non-vax-archs" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[non-vax-like]</sup></a>Most good programs are portable to at least Windows and most UNIXes and potentially portable to other platforms.</p><p>For example, Subversion has made it a high priority to work properly on Windows. On the other hand many of its early alternatives, especially GNU Arch, could not work there due to their architectures. As a result, many mixed shops, Windows-only shops, or companies where some developers wanted to use Windows as their desktop OS, could not use Arch. So Arch has seen a very small penetration.</p><p>The bootstrapping C compiler of gcc for example, is written in very portable <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#K.26R_C">K&amp;R C</a>, so it can be compiled by any C compiler. Later on, this compiler can be used to compile most of the rest of the GCC compilers.</p><p>Compare that to many compilers for other languages that are written in the same language. For example, <a class="link" href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC - The Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> is written in itself, and requires a relatively recent version of itself to compile itself. So you need to bootstrap several intermediate compilers to build it.</p></section></main>
