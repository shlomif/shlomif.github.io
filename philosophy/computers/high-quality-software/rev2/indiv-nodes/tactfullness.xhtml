<section xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="tactfullness" class="title">Good Social Engineering Skills</h4><h:a class="back_to_faq" href="../#tactfullness">Node Link</h:a></header><p>It certainly helps for the project&#8217;s communities to have good social engineering skills. From tactfulness, to humour, to controlling one&#8217;s temper, to saying &#8220;Thanks&#8221; and congratulating people for their contribution, to timely applying patches and fixing bugs - all of these makes contributing to a project and using the program more fun and less frustrating.</p><p>Often, social engineering should be made part of the design of the software, or the web-sites dedicated to it. For example, it took me several iterations of having to fill the same project form in <a class="link" href="http://savannah.gnu.org/">the GNU Savannah software-hub</a>, only for it to be rejected, and me having to follow the process again. Despite the fact the admins were polite, it still was annoying.</p><p>Eventually, they implemented a way to save previous project submissions and to re-send them, so future users won&#8217;t become as frustrated as I did.</p><p>Again, some projects have succeeded despite the fact they had, or even still have, bad social engineering. But adopting a good software engineering policy can certainly help a lot.</p></section></main>
