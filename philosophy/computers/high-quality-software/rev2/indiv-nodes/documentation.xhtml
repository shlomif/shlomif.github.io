However, a command line program, a library, etc. does need one, or else the user won&#8217;t know what to do.</p><p>There are many types of documentation: the <a class="link" href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/519/">--help flag</a>, the man page, the README/USAGE/INSTALL files, full-fledged in-depth guides, documents about the philosophy, wikis, etc. If the program is well-designed, then the user should be able to get up and running quickly. An exception to this are various highly specialised programs, such as 3-D graphics programs, or CAD programs, that require some extensive learning.</p><p>If we take Subversion as an example, then it has a <a class="link" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">full Book online</a>, several tutorials, an <code class="literal">svn help</code> command which provides help to all the other commands, and a lot of help can be found using a Google search. GNU Arch, on the other hand, only had one wordy tutorial, that I didn&#8217;t want to read. Most of the other tutorials people wrote, became misleading or non-functional as the program broke backwards compatibility.</p><p>Vim has an excellent internal documentation system. It&#8217;s the first thing you are directed see when invoking it. It has a comprehensive tutorial, a full manual, and the ability to search for many keywords, with a lot of redundancy. As a result, one can easily become better and better with vim or gvim, albeit many people can happily use it with only the bare essentials.</p><p>Emacs&#8217; help on the other hand is confusing, dis-organised, lacking in explanation and idiosyncratic. It doesn&#8217;t get invoked when pressing &#8220;F1&#8221;, is not directed to when the program starts, and most people cannot make heads nor tails of it. There is a short Emacs tutorial, but it isn&#8217;t as extensive as Vim&#8217;s. Nor does it explain how to configure Emacs to behave in a better way than its default, in which it behaves completely differently to what people who are used to Windows-like conventions or vim-like conventions expect.</p></section></main>
