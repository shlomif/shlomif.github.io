See <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000348.html">the <span class="emphasis"><em>Joel on Software</em></span> excellent article &#8220;Rub a dub dub&#8221;</a> for some of the motivation and practices of good refactoring instead of throwing away the code and restarting from scratch.</p><p>A reviewer of an early version of this article told me about an early and relatively large PHP code of her that was badly written, relatively buggy and yet proved to be popular among some of her clients, who have deployed it on many hosts and won&#8217;t effectively upgrade it. So she still has to maintain it, even though she&#8217;d rather not recommend it. She claimed that this is an indication that such low-quality in code, is a criterion of low-quality.</p><p>She has a point in the fact that usually badly-written or non-modular code results in more external low-quality factors such as bugs, security problems and lack of extensibility. However, even if the code was extremely well-written it is likely that it would need to be maintained, extended, and corrected. And if the clients in question don&#8217;t have or don&#8217;t want a good way to pull changes from a central place, or install updates properly, it&#8217;s a procedural and organisational problem.</p><p>Organisational quality deserves its own separate article (or arguably book, web-site, or even more than one book), but external software quality (much less internal one), is not a substitute for it.
