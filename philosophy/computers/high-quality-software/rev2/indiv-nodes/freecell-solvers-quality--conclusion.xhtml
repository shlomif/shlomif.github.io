While <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/to-do.html">it still has a lot of room for improvement</a>, the rest of its competition have much bigger issues, or have not been made available (yet or ever).</p><p>Several factors contributed for its success: the fact that I announced <a class="link" href="http://freshmeat.net/">many releases on Freshmeat.net</a>, that I received a lot of input from my users and co-developers, that I was determined to constantly improve it and work on it, and that I worked on creating and maintaining a good web-site and documentation.</p><p>While most of the contributions of code I received were limited, the input from the users of the software proved to be crucial for its prosperity. Like I noted earlier, I lost interest in working on it (at least temporarily), but still maintain it, and feel that it is good enough as it is.</p><p>I hope this document, and similar resources it referenced will help you in working on your software, and improving its quality for the benefit of your users and you.</p><p>Happy Hacking!</p></section></main>
