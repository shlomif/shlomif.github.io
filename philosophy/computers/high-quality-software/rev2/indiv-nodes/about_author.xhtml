He is a user, developer, advocate and activist of Open Source Software. His single greatest contribution so far in this area has been <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a>, a Public Domain Library for solving games of Freecell and other types of Solitaire. However, he also <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/projects/">initiated some other projects</a> and <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/contributions/">made important contributions to projects he did not initiate</a> some of them very large scale. Recently, most of his contribution were <a class="link" href="http://cpan.uwinnipeg.ca/~shlomif">perl distributions he uploaded to CPAN</a> under his username.</p><p>Fish&#8217;s work on Freecell Solver and other open source projects, and the fact he is interested in many software management techniques has led him to write <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/">a large number of articles</a>, and weblog entries which describe his unique views as a developer of mostly portable software.</p></section></main>
