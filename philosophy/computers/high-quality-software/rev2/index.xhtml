Low-quality software applications will require the users or end-developers to work around their bugs and limitations, write a lot of extra functionality themselves, and as a result, duplicate a lot of effort and cause a lot of frustration and unhappiness. This is assuming they don&#8217;t give up on it soon or right away, and end up looking for something else.</p><p>But what makes a popular software application &#8220;high-quality&#8221;? A high-quality program or library can be defined as one that is usable as is, that causes very few frustrations, and that requires little if any modifications or workarounds to get it up-to-speed.</p><p>I&#8217;m not talking about the application that&#8217;s the most hyped, or the fastest, most featureful, or best. Sometimes you can often hear endless rants and <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt">Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt (FUD)</a> attacks about it. Often, it has competing programs that are superior in many respects.</p><p>In this essay we&#8217;ll look at what quality metrics apply to software.</p><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="motivation" class="title">Motivation</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/motivation.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>How did it occur to me to ponder this question? I am active in the <a class="link" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/">fc-solve-discuss mailing list</a>, which is dedicated to computerised techniques for solving <a class="link" href="http://www.freecell.org/">the Freecell solitaire card game</a>, and for discussing other automated solving and research of Solitaire games. This mailing list was started after I wrote <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> (with a lowercase &#8220;c&#8221; and an uppercase &#8220;S&#8221;), an open-source solver, which has proven to be quite popular. However, the mailing list was not restricted to discussing it exclusively, and was joined by many other Freecell solving experts, researchers and enthusiasts.</p><p>Recently, Gary Campbell wrote <a class="link" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/fc-solve-discuss/message/741">this message</a> reading:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>I think the solver discussion in the Wikipedia should mention that the FCPro solvers give quite lengthy and virtually unusable solutions. No human wants to follow the several hundred steps that usually result in order to get at what&#8217;s really required to solve a given layout. If someone wants a solution that can be understood, they want one that is under 100 steps. This is a major contribution and it should be stated. There are a lot of <span class="bold"><strong>&#8220;toy&#8221;</strong></span> solvers and only a very few of <span class="bold"><strong>&#8220;industrial strength.&#8221;</strong></span> One of the latter is the solver by Danny Jones. I don&#8217;t see that on your list. The results he has gotten from his solver pretty much put your solver to shame. The more you hype Freecell Solver, the more criticism you open yourself up to.</p></blockquote></div><p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s hard for me to determine what &#8220;industrial strength&#8221;, &#8220;enterprise grade&#8221; and other such buzzwords are. But I&#8217;ll try to define high quality here, and try to show when a program is high quality.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="organisation" class="title">Organisation of this Document</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/organisation.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>I initially <span class="bold"><strong>wanted to give some examples</strong></span> for open-source software that I considered to be of exceptional high-quality, but I decided against it.</p><p>That&#8217;s because their exceptional quality is a matter of taste, and it may provoke too much criticism against this essay as a whole.

For example, GNU Arch, an old and now mostly unused version control program, did not work on Windows 32-bit, while Subversion, a different and popular alternative, has a native port. Moreover, Mercurial, a different alternative, cannot keep empty directories (or trees of directories not containing files) in the repository. This may make both Mercurial and GNU Arch a no-starter for many uses.</p><p><a class="link" href="http://www.tendra.org/">Tendra</a> is the most prominent alternative C and C++ compiler to GCC, but it&#8217;s hardly as advanced as GCC is, does not have all of GCC&#8217;s features and extensions, and is not usable as a replacement for GCC for most needs.

Or the case of <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/qmail/">the qmail email server</a>, which has a long and quirky build process. It reportedly fails to compile on modern Linuxes, and someone I know who tried to build it said that it did not work after following all the steps.</p><p>One thing that detracts from a piece of software being high-quality is a large amount of dependencies.</p><p>If we take <a class="link" href="http://plagger.org/">Plagger</a>, a web-feed mix-and-match framework in Perl (not unlike <a class="link" href="http://pipes.yahoo.com/">Yahoo Pipes</a>, but predates it), then its <a class="link" href="http://search.cpan.org/dist/Plagger/">Plagger distribution on CPAN</a> contains all of its plug-ins inside, and as a result requires &#8220;half of CPAN&#8221; including such obscure modules, as those for handling Chinese and Japanese dates.</p><p>Popular programs like GCC, perl 5, Vim, Subversion and Emacs have very few dependencies and they are normally included in the package, if necessary to build the system. They are all written in very portable C and POSIX and have been successfully deployed on all modern UNIX-flavours, on Microsoft Windows and on many other more obscure systems.</p><p>While reducing the number of dependencies often means re-inventing wheels, it still increases the quality of your software. I&#8217;m not saying a program cannot be high-quality if it has a large amount of dependencies, but it&#8217;s still a good idea to keep it to a minimum.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="has_packages" class="title">The Program Has Packages for Most Common Distributions</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/has_packages.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>A good program has packages for most common distributions, or such packages can be easily prepared.</p><p>Lack of such packages will require installing it from source, using generic binary packages, or other workarounds that are harder than a simple command to install the package from the package manager, and may prevent it from being maintained into the future.</p><p>A good example for how this can become wrong is the <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/anti/qmail/">qmail SMTP server</a>, before it became public-domain. The qmail copyright terms prevented distributing modified sources, or binary packages. As a result, the distributions that supported it packaged it as a source package, with an irregular build-process. Since the qmail package had its own unconventional idea of directory structure, some of the distributions had to extensively patch it. This in turn prevented more mainstream patches from being applied correctly to correct the many limitations that qmail had, or accumulated over the years due to its lack of maintenance.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="documentation" class="title">The Program Has Good, Extensive and Usable Documentation</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/documentation.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>If your GUI program is simple and well-designed, then you normally don&#8217;t need good documentation.

An exception to this are various highly specialised programs, such as 3-D graphics programs, or CAD programs, that require some extensive learning.</p><p>If we take Subversion as an example, then it has a <a class="link" href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">full Book online</a>, several tutorials, an <code class="literal">svn help</code> command which provides help to all the other commands, and a lot of help can be found using a Google search.

There is a short Emacs tutorial, but it isn&#8217;t as extensive as Vim&#8217;s. Nor does it explain how to configure Emacs to behave in a better way than its default, in which it behaves completely differently to what people who are used to Windows-like conventions or vim-like conventions expect.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="portability" class="title">Portability</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/portability.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>It is tempting to believe that by writing a program for one platform, you can gain most of your market-share. However, people are using many platforms on many different CPU architectures: Windows 32-bit/64-bit on Intel machines, Itanium, or x86-64; Linux on a multitude of platforms; BSD systems (NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD and others) on many architectures as well; Mac OS X; Sun Solaris (now also OpenSolaris), and more obscure (but still popular) Unix-clones like AIX, HP-UX, IRIX, SCO UNIX, Tru64 (formerly Digital Unix), etc. And to say nothing of more exotic, non-UNIX, non-Microsoft operating systems like Novell Netware, Digital Corp.s&#8217;s VMS or OpenVMS, IBM&#8217;s VM/CMS or OS/390 (MVS), BeOS, AmigaOS, Mac OS 9 or earlier, PalmOS, VxWorks, etc. etc.</p><p id="non-vax-archs">As a general rule, the only thing that runs on top of all of these systems (in the modern &#8220;All the world is a VAX.&#8221; world) is a C-based program or something that is C-hosted. <a href="#ftn.non-vax-archs" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[non-vax-like]</sup></a>Most good programs are portable to at least Windows and most UNIXes and potentially portable to other platforms.</p><p>For example, Subversion has made it a high priority to work properly on Windows. On the other hand many of its early alternatives, especially GNU Arch, could not work there due to their architectures. As a result, many mixed shops, Windows-only shops, or companies where some developers wanted to use Windows as their desktop OS, could not use Arch. So Arch has seen a very small penetration.</p><p>The bootstrapping C compiler of gcc for example, is written in very portable <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)#K.26R_C">K&amp;R C</a>, so it can be compiled by any C compiler. Later on, this compiler can be used to compile most of the rest of the GCC compilers.</p><p>Compare that to many compilers for other languages that are written in the same language. For example, <a class="link" href="http://www.haskell.org/ghc/">GHC - The Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> is written in itself, and requires a relatively recent version of itself to compile itself. So you need to bootstrap several intermediate compilers to build it.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="security" class="title">Security</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/security.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>A high-quality program is secure.

For example, once I was talking with a certain UNIX expert, and he argued that the Win32 <a class="link" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms682425.aspx">CreateProcess() system call</a> was superior to the UNIX combination of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork-exec">Fork() and Exec()</a>, just because it made some bugs harder to code. However, some multitasking paradigms are not possible, without the fork() system call, which is not present in the Win32 API at all, and needs to be emulated (at a high run-time cost) or replaced with thread-based multitasking, which is not identical. Finally, it is still possible to get fork()+exec() right, and there&#8217;s a spawn() abstraction on many modern UNIXes.</p><p>While I don&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t pay attention to security, or keep good security practices in mind when coding, I&#8217;m saying that it shouldn&#8217;t slow down the process by much, or prevent too many exciting features from being added, or cause the development to stagnate.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="backwards_compatiblity" class="title">Backwards Compatibility</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/backwards_compatiblity.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>A high-quality program maintains as much <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backward_compatibility">backward compatibility</a> with its older versions as possible.

Furthermore, sometimes existing user-land code was broken in minor-digit releases. As such, maintaining PHP code into the future is a very costly process, especially if you want it to work with a range of versions.</p><p>On the other hand, the perl5 developers have been maintaining backwards compatibility between 5.000, 5.001, 5.002 up to 5.6.x, 5.8.x and now 5.10.x. Therefore, one can normally expect older scripts to just work. perl5 can also run a lot of Perl 4 code and below, and Perl 4 code can be ported to modern versions of perl5 with relative ease. While sometimes scripts, programs or modules were broken (due to lack of &#8220;bug-to-bug compatibility&#8221;), or became slower, upgrading to a new version of Perl is normally straightforward.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="good_ways_to_provide_support" class="title">Good Ways to Provide Support</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/good_ways_to_provide_support.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>A piece of high-quality software has good ways for its users to receive support.

For example, as <a class="link" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/javacover.html">Paul Graham notes regarding Java</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>[Java] has been so energetically hyped. Real standards don&#8217;t have to be promoted. No one had to promote C, or Unix, or HTML. A real standard tends to be already established by the time most people hear about it. On the hacker radar screen, Perl is as big as Java, or bigger, just on the strength of its own merits.</p></blockquote></div><p>In fact, I can argue that if your project receives a lot of negative hype, then it is an indication that it is successful. Perl, for example, <a class="link" href="http://perl-begin.org/learn/myth-dispelling/">has received (and still receives) a lot of criticism</a>, and Perl aficionados often get tired of constantly hearing or seeing the same repetitive and tired arguments by its opponents. However, the perl 5 interpreter is in good shape, it has many automated tests (much more than most other competing dynamic languages), an active community, many modules on CPAN ( the Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) with a lot of third-party , open-source functionality, and relatively few critical bugs. It is still heavily actively used and has many fans.</p><p>Similar criticism has been voiced against <a class="link" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">the Subversion version control system</a>, Linux, etc. One thing one can notice about such highly-criticised projects is that they tend not to be bothered by it too much. Rather, what they say is that &#8220;If you want to use a competing project, I won&#8217;t stop you. It probably is good. It may be better in some respects. I like my own project and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m used to using and use.&#8221;</p><p>This is by all means the right policy of &#8220;hyping&#8221; to adopt, if you want your project to be successful based on its own merits. Some projects compete for the same niche, without voicing too much hype against each other or for them, and this is a better indication that they are all healthy.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="good-name" class="title">A Good Name</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/good-name.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>Finally, a project should have a good name.

Imagine that you are writing a Freecell game for an embedded device running a non-x86 architecture such as <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture">ARM</a> or <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PowerPC">PowerPC</a>. In that case, in order to run Campbell&#8217;s solver, you&#8217;ll need to embed an x86-and-DOS emulator (such as <a class="link" href="http://www.dosbox.com/">DOSBox</a>) inside the device, which will complicate things, consume a lot of memory, and slow things down. On the other, a C-based solver, such as Freecell Solver, or Tom Holroyd&#8217;s Patsolve, can be easily made to compile and run there with few if any modifications. So they would be preferable.</p><p id="portions-in-assembly">Similarly, when writing <span class="bold"><strong>portable programs</strong></span> for <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix">the various Unix flavours</a> and other POSIX-capable or C-capable operating-systems, then writing code in x86 Assembly exclusively will make it a non-starter. <a href="#ftn.portions-in-assembly" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[Assembly]</sup></a></p><p id="quality-analysis--build-system">Some Freecell solvers also <a class="link" href="#easy_to_compile_and_install" title="The Program is Easy to Compile, Deploy and Install">don&#8217;t build out of the box</a>. For example, typing <code class="literal">make</code> inside the patsolve distribution yields the following output:</p><pre class="programlisting">

        </pre><p>This is relatively easy to fix, but still frustrating. Freecell Solver on the other hand, has been fully converted to the GNU Autotools, and can be built as a static and shared library (a.k.a DLL). It also has some built-in proof-of-concept, but still usable, command line utilities that link against it.</p><p id="quality-analysis--usability">Freecell Solver has very good <span class="bold"><strong>usability</strong></span>: it mostly respects <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/">the Unix conventions and best practices</a>, it can start solving from any arbitrary Solitaire board position given to it as input, and has kept command line interface usability in mind. Campbell&#8217;s solver on the other hand, as of this writing, does not operate on a standard input/standard output manner, is poorly documented, and is counter-intuitive for someone who is used to Unix conventions (and most DOS conventions). I&#8217;m not even sure it can accept any arbitrary board as input, but I may be wrong.</p><p id="quality-analysis--homepage">Regarding <span class="bold"><strong>the homepage</strong></span> of the solver: the <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver homepage</a> has many pages, a navigation menu, a common look-and-feel and many links and information. On the other hand, Patsolve&#8217;s homepage is nothing but a link in <a class="link" href="http://members.tripod.com/professor_tom/archives/">Tom Holroyd&#8217;s software archive</a>, which can easily be missed. Gary Campbell&#8217;s <a class="link" href="http://www.numin8r.us/programs/">homepage for his solver</a> has a Baroque design and quite a lot of marketing-speak. And it&#8217;s only one page with no anchors or a navigation menu, and very few links. Most other solvers don&#8217;t fare better than that, and certainly worse than my own.</p><p id="fcs-pd"><span class="bold"><strong>Licensing</strong></span>, a necessary, but important, evil. The Freecell Solver&#8217;s C source is distributed under the Public Domain licence, which allows virtually any use, including linking, modifying and sublicensing under any different licence by a third party.<a href="#ftn.fcs-pd" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[PD-LICENSE]</sup></a> On the other hand, Patsolve is distributed under the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GPL licence</a> which while usable is considerably more restrictive than Public Domain, or BSD-style licences. This is also the case for <a class="link" href="http://kevin.atkinson.dhs.org/freecell/">this Common Lisp solver</a> by Kevin Atkinson and Shari Holstege. Many other solvers, including Campbell&#8217;s are binary-only, &#8220;All Rights Reserved&#8221;, which makes them a complete no-starter for most open-source applications out there. Furthermore, many non-open-source applications will prefer to use a Public Domain solver, rather than paying royalties or risking &#8220;copyrights&#8221; and source availability problems.</p><p id="quality-analysis--documentation">Freecell Solver (FCS) is extensively documented, and even its <a class="link" href="http://freshmeat.net/articles/view/519/">online help is helpful and usable by itself</a>. The other solvers are much less documented, but arguably they also have much fewer options and features than Freecell Solver does.</p><p id="quality-analysis--features">Which brings us to the features - Freecell Solver has <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/features.html">a long list of features</a>, and I&#8217;m not aware of any other solver with so many. Especially of note is that it can solve many other Solitaire variants, including <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Simon_(solitaire)">Simple Simon</a>, of which FCS is probably the only solver capable of solving.</p><p id="quality-analysis--speed">Most of the solvers out there are fast, but some are more than others. Normally, for solving an individual game on the command-line, almost any solver will do, and the only cases where such speed matters more is for Solitaire research, and for analysing large sets of different games. (see the <a class="link" href="http://www.solitairelaboratory.com/fcfaq.html">Freecell FAQ</a> for more information).</p><p id="quality-analysis--solution-length">In his original message, Mr. Campbell claimed that the <a class="link" href="http://www.rrhistorical.com/rrdata/Fcpro65/">Freecell Pro</a> solvers (Freecell Solver, Patsolve and the solver that originated from Don Woods) generated long and unusable solutions. That has not been my experience with Freecell Solver in some of its (practically infinite) configurations. Using the so-called &#8220;good-intentions&#8221; configuration I typically get solutions that are less than 200 moves. It is highly possible this is not the default in Freecell Pro. But like I said, there are many different parameters for quality than just speed and solution-length. Another fact worth of noting is that a beta-tester who tried out some of the Freecell Solver solutions in Freecell Pro, said that he found them to be very &#8220;creative&#8221; and interesting.</p><p id="quality-analysis--other-advantages">Freecell Solver has some other advantages: it is capable of being fully instantiated, as it stores everything in an &#8220;instance&#8221; C-struct, while using global variables only for constants (and not using static variables). This makes doing parallelised testing using mutli-threading much easier. It also has namespace-purity in the sense that all variables start with the <code class="literal">freecell_solver_</code> prefix. Moreover, FCS has a well-defined and stable API, which is not well-documented, but should be easy-to-use.</p><p>Part of the API is a parser for a list of command-line-like strings, which allow for configuring without making many standalone function calls.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="freecell-solvers-quality--conclusion" class="title">Conclusion</h4><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/freecell-solvers-quality--conclusion.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>All things considered, I still feel that Freecell Solver is probably the best quality Solitaire solver out there.
