I can tell from my experiences with the various BASICs, which were the first languages I learnt, that BASIC was fun because it was useful. Using BASIC on the old Intel-based computers, one could write games, graphical demos, text processing and command execution scripts, and even serious applications. While BASIC is in today&#8217;s standards a very limited language that should no longer be taught as a first language, I still fondly remember it as being a lot of fun. I even continued using BASIC after I learned C and what was then C++, because it was quicker and more convenient. (I no longer do, because I now feel that Perl is superior to BASIC in every way, and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m using now.)</p><p>On the other hand, Scheme as in SICP is an awful choice for an introductory programming language, because it feels very impractical. Writing quick and dirty code to do a lot of things in Scheme is very verbose, and plus, the core standard lacks many primitives for common <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX">POSIX</a> operations (like random file I/O, directories, sockets, etc.) much less useful APIs. While some Scheme implementations provide extensions to the language, they do so in different incompatible ways.</p><p>Different people I talked to, agreed with me that &#8220;You cannot do anything with Scheme&#8221;. Compare it to languages such as C and C++, Perl/Python/Tcl/Ruby/PHP, Java/.NET, etc. that feel very practical, and you&#8217;ll see why hardly any industrial-strength code is written in Scheme.</p><p>Teaching a language just for teaching programming with, is sub-optimal because the students cannot take this language with them and perform real-world tasks with it. They will have less motivation to experiment on their own, and to remember it for long.</p></section></main>
