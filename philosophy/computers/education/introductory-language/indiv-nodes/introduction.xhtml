Then I will propose and explain some relations (&#8220;Language A should be learned before Language B&#8221;) that are good to follow. After that, I will propose my verdict, and discuss some orthogonal alternatives. Finally, I will discuss some different types of teaching and how each should be conducted differently.</p><p>As for how I started programming myself, I should note that I learned BASIC at the age of 10 (back in 1987), and then learned C when I was 15 years old (in 1992); I later learned <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_for_Applications">Visual Basic for Applications</a> and when I was 19 years old I was introduced to Perl and UNIX at my workplace, which was a web site creation shop (back in 1996, when the Internet started to become popular). I have later learned other languages and technologies and still do to a large extent.</p><p>One note that is in order is that you shouldn&#8217;t feel bad about having followed a different ordered in the programming languages you&#8217;ve learned. By all means, you can still learn things on your own otherwise.</p></section></main>
