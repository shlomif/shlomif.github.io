This requires more understanding, because you have to work with the material.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>Level 3 - Teaching</strong></span> - in this level you teach the material to someone else. This requires the most understanding because you need to organise it properly and convey it to someone else.</p></li></ol></div><p>Perhaps there&#8217;s a fourth level - <span class="bold"><strong>Science</strong></span> in which the knowledge is expanded. However, this implies that to truly understand the material, one needs to experiment with it (preferably in production) and better yet teach it to someone else.</p><p id="those_who_can_footnote">The old adage &#8220;He who can - does. He who cannot - teaches.&#8221; which was <a class="link" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Bernard_Shaw">said by George Bernard Shaw</a> is amusing, but simply not true, as I&#8217;ve demonstrated here. Being a great teacher is much more difficult than being a great doer, and is much more enlightening. <a href="../#ftn.those_who_can_footnote" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[those_who_can]</sup></a></p></section></main>
