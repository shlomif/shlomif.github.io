However, most of what programmers have to do for work or for pro-bono work (like open source projects) is to read code, and to enhance existing code.</p><p><a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel Spolsky (&#8220;Joel on Software&#8221;)</a> gave the following &#8220;cardinal rule of programming&#8221; in his famous <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html">&#8220;Things you must never do, part I&#8221; essay</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>It&#8217;s harder to read code than to write it.</p></blockquote></div><p>My friends and I later <a class="link" href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/hackers-il/message/3576">discussed this topic in the Hackers-IL mailing list</a>. Even if code is given for reading in university, it is usually extremely well-written, highly organised, highly legible, code, rather than the real code that programmers are likely to encounter in the wild.</p><p>It&#8217;s a shame most of the code students write as part of their curriculum is only for themselves, and ends up being of little value to the world at large. Even if some code ends up as an open source project, it is usually too incomplete and lacks essential functionality or correctness to be of any use in the real world.</p><p>As Joel points out in the article, most programmers end up saying that the code they are working on is horrible and that they wish to completely rewrite it if they have the chance, instead of <a class="link" href="http://www.refactoring.com/">refactoring</a> it to make it better.</p><p>Furthermore, since reading code is harder than writing it, then it makes sense that programmers who are good at reading (or refactoring code or enhancing it) are much better programmers, than programmers who are only good at writing new code. I wish I had a dollar for every time I heard of someone trying to rewrite an existing functional and relatively bug-free codebase from scratch, just because this codebase was deemed of too little quality, and that afterwards this rewrite ended up at nothing. These cases practically dwarf the number of successful rewrites I recall.</p><p>To sum up, it will be a good idea to teach first-time programmers how to read real-world code, or the code written by their co-students, and how to enhance it by extending it, and cleaning it up.</p></section></main>
