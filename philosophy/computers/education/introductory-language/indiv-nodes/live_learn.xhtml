Learn as if you were to live forever.&#8221;</h4><h:a class="back_to_faq" href="../#live_learn">Node Link</h:a></header><p>This is a quote attributed to <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi">Gandhi</a>. The &#8220;Learn like you were going to live forever&#8221; part is not widely understood by many workers. Many programmers believe that their knowledge of a few programming languages is enough, and that it is not necessary that they learn completely different ones.</p><p>It is well known that learning a new and different programming language will make you a better programmer also in the original languages you know. Programmers who don&#8217;t learn new programming languages eventually stagnate. They are bounded by their limited knowledge, and cannot think outside their box. They deserve the stagnation they receive due to this bad attitude, and mental laziness.</p><p>If you want to grow as a programmer, make sure you keep studying new languages and technologies. Not only they may turn out to be useful, but they&#8217;ll also make you think in completely different ways.</p></section></main>
