So far all the limited tasks I tried to accomplish using it worked well after some trial and error, but I still did not take the time to thoroughly study it.</p><p>Ruby was written after its creator was unhappy to some extent with both Perl (possibly 4 at the time) and Python, and so he created a language that tried to combine the best elements of Smalltalk, Perl and Python. Ruby aims to be elegant and consistent, yet still very expressive and shares Perl&#8217;s &#8220;There&#8217;s more than one way to do it&#8221; philosophy.</p><p>As of version 1.x, Ruby does not support multi-threaded programming, has poor support for Unicode, and is much slower than Perl or Python. Some of these problems will be addressed in Ruby 2.x.</p><p>The worst problem with Ruby, however, is the lack of good documentation. Ruby has <a class="link" href="http://www.rubycentral.com/book/">one old edition of the &#8220;Programming Ruby&#8221; book</a> available online, and that&#8217;s it. Furthermore, this book is intended for absolute beginners and will be too slow paced for people with extensive experience in similar languages.</p><p>All the other books from the Pragmatic Programmer series are not available online (including the new editions of the &#8220;Programming Ruby&#8221; book). What many people end up doing is downloading them from &#8220;warez&#8221; sites or from Peer-to-Peer networks, but I wouldn&#8217;t encourage professors to tell their students to do that.</p><p>I recall trying to find out how to tag methods in Ruby, in a similar way to Perl&#8217;s method or variable attributes. Google was no help and no one on Freenode on #ruby-lang told me and I asked several times, and people tried to research it. Eventually, someone I knew on #perl was able to give me the answer. He then claimed that many of the slightly more unconventional, but useful, tricks in Ruby were completely undocumented.</p><p>As such, one may still encounter problems teaching Ruby as an introductory language. If these problems are remedied by the Ruby community, with some amount of work and effort, then this may be better.</p></section></main>
