Languages like Pascal, Ada, Java, and many others were designed to try to save programmers from themselves. And indeed many people believe that programmers should start learning from such a language.</p><p>What&#8217;s wrong with this approach? Several things:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The more strict the language is, then generally the less expressive it is. Programmers like to express themselves and be able to implement algorithms using the entire power of the language. They don&#8217;t want to declare a lot of type definitions, many constraints, write a lot of syntax, or otherwise be encumbered in the way.</p><p id="haskell_expressive_power">It may actually make them think programming is loathsome or otherwise a very strict process instead of a very creative process.<a href="../#ftn.haskell_expressive_power" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[haskell]</sup></a></p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Often, the trial and error will be good for them. Plus, even writing some disorganised, but functional code is better than the program taking them much more time to write (and more time to read and understand after writing).</p><p>I don&#8217;t expect them to become superb programming in a day. Becoming a better programmer is a process, and cannot be taught in a semester or a year of hard work.</p></li></ul></div></section></main>
