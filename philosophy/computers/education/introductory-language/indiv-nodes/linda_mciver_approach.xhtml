The article makes a very good read.</p><p>Later on, <a class="link" href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~lindap/papers/LindaMcIverThesis.pdf">her Ph.D. thesis</a> introduced her idea of a good introductory programming language.</p><p>Now, if I had to summarise this language in one word it would be this: sexless. It&#8217;s incredibly limited, not flexible, and not fun. It has no pointers or references and instead relies on nested structures and arrays. There are two basic data types - a number and a string. The language does not have functions as first-order objects, closures, or objects and classes in the Object Oriented Programming sense. Furthermore, it has very few ways for one to express oneself. As a result implementing many algorithms would be very difficult in it.</p><p>When I program, I&#8217;m using every tool in my arsenal, and expect the language to be powerful enough to be able to translate my thoughts into code. McIver&#8217;s language is too limited and limiting, to be effective for programming in, and being planned exclusively for beginners, lacks the richness and interesting idioms that make programmers like or even love their languages.</p><p>This is a language that I won&#8217;t enjoy programming in. And I don&#8217;t believe a professor who doesn&#8217;t enjoy programming in a certain language can effectively convey it to his students, while lacking the enthusiasm and love for the tool he chose.</p><p>McIver&#8217;s approach is flawed in the sense that she is trying too hard to save the students from all possible problems they may encounter in trying to understand their introductory language. However, programming is hard to learn, and learning the first language is always difficult. Creating a &#8220;flawless&#8221; language that lacks any sex-appeal is not going to make it better, but much worse as both the professors and programmers will detest it.</p></section></main>
