I too have read the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was too based on “feeling rather than knowing”. Joel later on posted many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people still recalled it as a very low-point in the blog.</p><p>Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles and essays about my thoughts, and this time I’ve decided to risk something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic: <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences of open-source software</a>. I’m going to introduce the various options, explain a little about their motivation and then give some advice according to my own personal opinion.</p><p id="ianal">I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according to my best knowledge, understanding and experience. <a href="#ftn.ianal" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[IANAL]</sup></a> I think what I’m writing here is correct, but would still appreciate any correction for future versions. If you’re unsure about my advice, then you should consult a legal expert (if you can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.</p><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="spoiler" class="title">Spoiler</h4></div></div></div><p>In this spoiler I’ll explain what I’m using right away, which is also what I recommend other people to use. When I started releasing my code as open-source software, I used <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the Public Domain</a>. So, for example, <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> which is one of my earliest projects and still one of the most successful, used to carry a <code class="filename">COPYING</code> file with the following contents:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Relax, this is not GPL software, but rather it is distributed under the public domain. It means it can be linked against anything, converted to any different license, freely used and distributed, and anything else without any restrictions whatsoever. No Strings Attached!™</p></blockquote></div><p>(This was also a joke of sorts.)</p><p>Later on, to avoid the problematic status of public domain code in many countries, and to avoid other potential legal problems, I started distributing my original code under <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_license">the MIT X11 Licence</a>, a permissive licence which is close to the Public Domain. If the project I’m contributing to has a different licence, then I disclaim any explicit or implicit ownership on the code I wrote, and allow the existing copyright holders to do with my code as they see fit.</p><p>Note that I’m using different terms for other types of digital artworks. Most of my essays (including this one) are under the <a class="link" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</a>, my original (i.e: non-derived-work or fan-art) fictitious stories are often under <a class="link" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike Licence</a> or <a class="link" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons — Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> (which is more GPL-like), and most of the photos I took and published were placed under the Public Domain.</p></section></section><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="types-of-licences" class="title">Types of Licences</h3></div></div></div><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="what-is-a-free-software-licence" class="title">What is a Free Software Licence?</h4></div></div></div><p>According to the <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software Definition</a> free software must fulfil 4 freedoms:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The freedom to run the program, for any purpose</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The freedom to study how the program works, and adapt it to your needs.

This is usually not an issue, because the majority of open source software out there is free as well. (And few people would like to create an open-source licence that’s not endorsed by the Free Software foundation.)</p><p>A software licence qualifies as a free software/open-source licence, if it allows those four freedoms. There’s still a lot of room to manoeuvre and to impose various restrictions, but otherwise these freedoms make them usable enough for the users and co-developers.</p></section><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="permissive-licences" class="title">Permissive Licences</h4></div></div></div><p>The first type of licences are <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissive_free_software_licence">Permissive free software licences</a>, also known as <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">BSD-style licences</a>, or <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copycenter">“Copycenter licences”</a>. These licences allow you to do almost anything conceivable with the program and its source code, including distributing then, selling them, using the resultant software for any purpose, incorporating into other software, or even converting copies to different licences, including that of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprietary_software">non-free (so-called “proprietary”) software</a>.</p><p>Probably the only two actions none of these licences allow is removing the original copyright notice, or suing the creator of the software for damages (the latter is due to the “no warranty” clause). Some of them pose some additional requirements that do not detract from their permissive nature.</p><p>Prominent examples of Public Domain licences include:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BSD_licenses">The various BSD licences</a>, under which the “Berkeley Software Development” UNIX variant were made available. The original 4-clause BSD licence contained an additional <a class="link" href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/bsd.html">advertising clause</a>, that required publishing the names of the copyright holders on every advertising material. This proved to be a problem and was rendered GPL-incompatible and so using this licence is no longer recommended.</p><p>Later on, the advertising clause was removed to formulate the 3-clause and 2-clause BSD licences, which are both less problematic and GPL-compatible.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT X11 Licence</a> was created by MIT for their X Window System software. It explicitly allows to do many activities with the licensed code, including sub-licensing, which means converting derived works of the code to different licences.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_License">The Apache License</a> was formulated for the Apache project and has seen several revisions. It includes some language to deal with patent-related issues. The latest version - Apache 2.0 was partially created in order to be compatible with version 2 of the GPL, but the FSF ruled the Apache Licence as incompatible with it. The Apache Licence, however, was declared as compatible with version 3 of the GPL.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">The ISC licence</a> is functionally equivalent to the 2-clause BSD-licence, with some “language made unnecessary by the Berne convention removed”. This licence is also favoured by the <a class="link" href="http://www.openbsd.org/">OpenBSD project</a>.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_License">Version 2.0 of the Artistic License</a>, which was formulated by <a class="link" href="https://www.perlfoundation.org/">The Perl Foundation</a>, is used by the Parrot Virtual Machine, some <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_(programming_language)">Perl 6/Raku</a> implementations, and other projects. The original Artistic License has problematic phrasing, and is not recommended for general use, unless possibly when dually licensed with a different licence (as is the case for perl 5 and many Perl modules on the CPAN).</p><p>An anecdote about this licence is that it <a class="link" href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/02/rem-releases-videos-under-artistic-license-20.html">was chosen by R.E.M for licensing some video-clips</a> from one of their albums.</p></li></ol></div></section><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="weak-copyleft-licences" class="title">Weak Copyleft Licences</h4></div></div></div><p>Weak <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft">Copyleft</a> licences are free software licences that mandate that source code that descended from software licensed under them, will remain under the same, weak copyleft, licence. However, one can still <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker">link</a> to weak copyleft code from code under a different licence (including non-open-source code), or otherwise incorporate it in a larger software.</p><p>Otherwise, weak copyleft licences allow free distribution, use , selling copies of the code or the binaries (as long as the binaries are accompanied by the (unobfuscated) source code), etc.</p><p>Examples of weak copyleft licences include:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License">The GNU Lesser General Public Licence (or LGPL for short)</a> - this licence was formulated by the <a class="link" href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> based on the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public Licence (or GPL)</a>. Its text is longer than the GPL, and it is reportedly a more complicated licence. Other than the general “you-can-link-it-against-everything-as-long-as-you-keep-inclusive-code-LGPLed”, it allows an explicit conversion to the GPL, has patent-related clauses, and contains many additional restrictions.</p><p>Version 2 of the LGPL was succeeded by version 2.1, and now there’s also version 3 which is based on a short adaptation of the version 3 of the GPL (see below).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p id="MozillaPL"><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License">The Mozilla Public Licence (or MPL)</a> was phrased for the public source release of the <a class="link" href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla project</a>. It was characterised as a hybridisation of the modified BSD licence and the GPL. Initially, this licence was ruled as GPL-incompatible, which eventually caused the Mozilla project to re-license its code under a triple MPL, GPL and LGPL licence. Version 2.0 of the MPL has GPL and LGPL compatibility.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>GPL with an Exemption Clause</strong></span> - the GPL is a <a class="link" href="#strong-copyleft-licences" title="Strong Copyleft Licences">strong copy-left licence</a>, but sometimes an additional clause is added that allows it to be linked against code of non-GPL-compatible licences (including non-open-source code). This strategy was chosen by Sun Microsystems when they decided to release <a class="link" href="http://www.java.com/">the source of the Java programming language</a> under an open-source licence.</p></li></ol></div></section><section class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="strong-copyleft-licences" class="title">Strong Copyleft Licences</h4></div></div></div><p>Strong copyleft licences go a step further from weak copyleft licences and mandate that any distributed software that links or otherwise incorporates such code be licensed under compatible licences, which are a subset of the available open-source licences.

The GPL has a complicated language (I read the GPL version 2 once and did not fully understand it) and has some additional restrictions beyond just making sure that code incorporating its code would be under compatible, open-source licences.</p><p>Note that there is a difference between the GPL version 2, and the GPL version 3 and that they are mutually incompatible. Some people use the language “Licensed under the GNU General Public Licence, version 2, or at your option any later version” which avoids this problem. However, many projects including <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_kernel">the Linux kernel</a> are GPL version 2 only.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepycat_License">The Sleepycat License</a>. This licence was formulated by Sleepycat Software (now part of <a class="link" href="http://www.oracle.com/">Oracle</a>) for use in their Berkeley DB database product. The reason this licence was chosen instead of the GPL was because the source for the Berkeley DB was originally written under one of the BSD licences, and it was not clear whether it was possible to sub-license it under the GPL.</p><p>The Sleepycat licence is short and has a simple language, and is easy to understand. From my reading of it, it seems that it is both recursive (requires code that originated from it to be licensed under the same licence) and that it mandates releasing the source code of software applications that linked against it, but under a non-specified (and possibly non-free) licence.</p><p>Sleepycat has also provided a commercial licence for using Berkeley DB which allows incorporating it into a larger work without the need to release the source. This is a valid business model used by originators of GPL-licensed software and other strong copyleft licences.

Even <a class="link" href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.642822.36">the LGPL is reportedly problematic</a></p><p>The GPL and LGPL are of more political nature than other similar FOSS licences, and as such should be avoided. I recommend using the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepycat_License">Sleepycat licence</a>, which is a strong-copyleft licence, that is compatible with GPLv2 and above, instead of the GPL and the <a class="link" href="#MozillaPL">MPL</a> 2.0 (or above) licence instead of the LGPL. Naturally, permissive, non-copyleft, open-source licences such as the MIT Expat Licence are an option. What the Sleepycat licence says is that code distributed under it, must remain under it, and that one must release the source code for publicly-distributed binaries that link against it. However, from my understanding, as opposed to the GPL, this source code doesn’t have to be completely free. It doesn’t have the additional restrictions on licences compatibility that the GPL has, nor does it have the other obscure and not-well-understood restrictions that the GPL has.</p><p>I read the GPLv2 originally once and couldn’t understand it. The LGPLv2 or the GPLv3 would likely prove to be more problematic. I find it harder to trust lengthy documents that I am unable to understand. I had no problem understanding the Sleepycat licence, the Artistic 2.0 licence, or the MIT X11 and BSD licences, so I can better recommend them instead.</p><p>One fact I should note is that the GPL often stands against <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude">the Hacker’s attitude</a> as presented by Eric Raymond in <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">the document “How to become a Hacker”</a>.

I’d like to reply to it here.</p><p>Quoting from the comment:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In the second half of the 90s, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X-Windows</a> was quite popular - a department (in universities, companies, etc.) would have strong Unix workstations (from Sun, DEC, SGI, HP and other vendors) and people would have cheaper machines showing the output from the strong machine using X-Windows. As MS-Windows grew popular, people wanted to use their PC running Windows to display X-Windows sessions. But unfortunately, the only X server available for Windows was commercial software (Exceed), which could happen because X was BSD-licensed and not GPL. Users (at the time, most had corporate or university funds - they weren’t home users) bit the bullet and paid. It took literally years before a free X server for Windows became available.</p></blockquote></div><p>My response is that this was indeed a problem and inconvenienced the users of Exceed. However, if X-Windows were GPLed, then the people who made Exceed and wanted to sell it, might not have made it in the first place, because they had to make it GPLed and keep it as FOSS. So either they would have implemented it from scratch or not at all. It is possible that a different group would have created a free X server for Windows, but it is possible that no free X server would have been available at all. And if a different group could have created a free X server for Windows without Exceed, they could have certainly created it with it.</p><p>Furthermore, If X11 had been initiated under a non-BSD-style-licence, then it is possible it would not have become as ubiquitous as it is in the UNIX world, thus making it irrelevant to port it to Windows in the first place. We can’t tell that for sure, but I think it is a possibility.</p><p>Quoting again:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>For example, someone integrated my <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver library</a> in a <a class="link" href="http://www.ambermango.com/php/am/f3d/index.php">shareware (without source) game he wrote titled Freecell 3D</a>.</p><p>He sells the game online. It did not do any damage, because there are plenty of Freecell implementations around. I on my part am pretty happy with the open-source PySolFC.</p></blockquote></div><p>Let’s imagine that you wrote a great Freecell solver library, but you suck at UI and failed to create a graphical game based on that library, and wish that someone created a UI on top of your library. If your library is BSD, someone could create this UI but make it commercial and not even you can use it. If your library is GPL, this person is forced to either make his code public (so you and your friends can use it) or pay you for a new license. Which of those scenarios will make you happier? I can’t see how the GPL isn’t better in this scenario.</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, first of all I should note that that is a lot of “if”’s. When I started working on Freecell Solver, there were already plenty of graphical Freecell games, possibly with support for other variants of Solitaire. And there were also several open-source ones, including some very polished ones.</p><p>As a result, I could have easily integrated my solver into one of them. So his thought experiment is not very realistic, although it may be valid in the general case.</p><p>Back to the thought experiment, a person who would be interested in creating a commercial Freecell UI and still integrate a solving mechanism to it could:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Develop his own Freecell solving library from scratch. That will probably be less work than developing the rest of the graphical Freecell game.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Write a command line executable that uses the library, invoke it, and process its output.

Back when I got my first computer - an 8088 PC XT with two 5.25" 360 KB diskette drives, and no hard disk, I started programming in BASIC - first the one that came on the BIOS and then BASIC.COM or GWBASIC. (BASICA wouldn’t run on my computer, for some reason). Back then, I programmed mostly games and my friends and I shared tips and programs between ourselves.</p><p>I took a long break from programming, and then started programming BASIC again - this time <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a>. Then I got my father to buy a C compiler and he bought me Turbo C++, which I used for somewhat more “serious” stuff than BASIC (though I still used QBasic). Back then I wrote two libraries-of-sorts - called CCalc (for various mathematical routines) and CSee (for graphics) which I intended to distribute as shareware. I don’t recall if I planned to include the source.</p><p>I’ve now made them, and some other C code from that era, <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/nostalgia/">available as free and open source software under the Expat Licence</a>.</p><p>In any case, back then we were used to the fact that we have to pay for our software, so I probably thought that making these libraries public-domain was not worth it.</p><p>After I started getting into the world of UNIX, Linux, GNU, and open-source I realised there was a lot of software out there distributed with the source, which I could download and compile. I used to think of prep.ai.mit.edu (the old primary FTP host for gnu.org) as a cool collection of source code, which I could download, read the INSTALL file, build and install (sometimes after fixing the source). I wasn’t interested in the implications of its open source nature or the GPL licence. I also downloaded other software. I did know the software was gratis, as opposed to <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSQL">MiniSQL/mSQL</a> which was sourceware and shareware. That was good enough for me.</p><p>After I became more involved and started playing with Linux for developing software on it, I learned even more and understood what “free (as in speech) software” (or as it was later called “open-source software”) was all about. One thing I understood back then, was that it took me a long time to fully get to the bottom of all the GPL’s nuances, and that I thought the public domain was preferable, because I didn’t care too much about people changing the licence to something else, or using it in their own non-free/non-GPL-compatible software. A lot of people I have talked with since have shown many misunderstandings of the GPL.</p><p>In any case, I had initiated some FOSS projects under the public-domain which didn’t amount to a lot. I also wrote <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/grad-fu/">a patch for GIMP</a> which I made available, but has since then taken some other iterations and incarnations to be embedded. And then I released <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> (originally under the Public Domain - now MIT/Expat) and did a lot of extensive work on it, and then started some other moderately successful MIT/Expat projects, or contributed to or adopted FOSS projects under various licences.</p><p>So why am I still sticking with the MIT/Expat licence? The main reason I think is that as an open-source programmer, I’m not interested in worrying about how people abuse my code. I don’t like Apple, and am not fond of many Microsoft products. But I’m not interested to prevent Apple or Microsoft or any other developer of commercial and/or proprietary software for Windows or Mac OS X or the iPhone or whatever from using my code in their projects. In fact, I would prefer them to use my code than to create a proprietary replacement. Not to mention that making my code GPLed may also make it inappropriate for reuse by some developers of BSD software, for inclusion into the core BSD distributions, for some developers of non-GPL-compatible-but-still-open-source software, etc. I don’t want that - I want my code to be of the maximal use possible.</p><p>I should note that I’m more worried about my code being used for malicious purposes by evil governments, as I think no big corporation in history has been as abusive as some past and present governments that come to mind. But preventing internal use or “defence use” or government use or whatever will make it non-FOSS, (and non-GPL-compatible), not to mention that adding random restrictions (“cannot be used by Neonazis”, “cannot be used by terrorists”, “cannot be used by ‘Zionists’”, etc.) will fragment the software licensing world as a whole, and I would prefer not to open that Pandora Box.</p><p>Back to the topic: I don’t want to be bothered about legal issues with my software. If you want to use my code - use it. “Drive safely, the keys are inside.”. If you encounter any technical problems with the code (bugs, documentation issues, etc.) then I’d be interested to hear about them, because that will improve the quality of the product, which will hopefully make it even more successful. But I didn’t become a FOSS developer so I can sue people for violating the licences of my works. I have better things to do with my time, that bring me much more benefit.</p><p>Now, on to the issue of whether developing BSD-style code makes me a “sucker”. I covered it earlier in <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/gpl-bsd-and-suckerism/">“The GPL, the BSD, and being a Sucker”</a> mini-essay.</p><p>To sum it up here, I don’t see why contributing to one’s neighbour (or the public at large), willingly and on one’s free time (which may be called “donation”, “philanthropy” or even “altruism”) and for a non-harmful cause can be considered as being a “sucker”. Everybody is able to use GPLed software of various originators too free-of-charge or put it into good use in many legal and legitimate ways and yet you don’t hear that often that people who develop GPLed software are “suckers”.</p><p>I don’t see myself as a sucker just by allowing third-parties (whether individuals, corporations, governments or any other organisations) to use my software in non-free contexts, and don’t think anyone should say that the GPL is the “don’t-be-a-sucker” licence because BSD-style licences are by implications “be-a-sucker” licence. I hate selfishness. (And I don’t mean “rational self-growth” or acting-out-of-one’s-own-best-self-interest, which is what Ayn Rand meant in the book <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness"><span class="emphasis"><em>The Virtue of Selfishness</em></span></a> - I discuss it in the link briefly).</p><p>Another argument that you can often hear against the BSDL was that the Linux kernel was more successful than the BSDs due to its GPLed licence. However, this is:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist compact"><li class="listitem"><p>A <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">post-hoc fallacy</a> - just because Linux is more successful than the BSDs, doesn’t mean that the licence was the main reason for it, or the only reason.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In accordance to #1 - may be attributed to other factors such as Linus Torvalds’ leadership skills, the kernel’s adoption of the Bazaar-style of development, the willingness of Linux distributions to use the GNU project’s software by default as run-time, <a class="link" href="https://libquotes.com/linus-torvalds/quote/lbi7o4k">the cooler name</a>, the lack of initial legal limbo that the BSDs had, etc. etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>One can find examples to projects in other niches that have been very successful despite their permissive licences - Apache, X-Windows, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Python, libxml2, OpenSSH, etc. So extrapolating from one instance (the kernel) to everything is not scientific.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The BSD-based kernels and operating systems are doing fine, despite not being as popular as Linux. Often, people use code from efforts by BSD developers in Linux (e.g: OpenSSH or some of the OpenBSD wireless drivers that were adapted and integrated into the Linux kernel). So it’s not as if, they have completely “lost”.</p></li></ol></div><p>While I’m still using GNU/Linux (Mandriva Linux Cooker in my case) because that’s what I’ve grown accustomed to using, I would still like to play with some BSD derivatives and OpenSolaris. I’m also not planning on switching to gNewSense or one of the Free Software Foundation’s endorsed “100% Free Distributions”, because Mandriva is free enough for me.</p><p>To sum up, I’m not trying to dissuade you from licensing your software under weak copyleft or strong copyleft licences, but I’m still happy with my code being BSD-style. I’m glad to learn of any use someone has been making of it, and in the few times it has been used in commercial or proprietary contexts, it did not make me regret that I released it as FOSS. I hadn’t wanted it to be an issue in the first place, and so it wasn’t. <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuna_matata"><span class="strong"><strong>Hakuna Matata</strong></span></a>.</p></section><div id="acknowledgements" class="acknowledgements"><p>Special thanks to <a class="link" href="http://migo.sixbit.org/about/">Mikhael Goikhman</a> who pointed several factual mistakes in an earlier revision of this essay.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr class="footnote-hr"/><div id="ftn.ianal" class="footnote"><p><a href="#ianal" class="para"><sup class="para">[IANAL] </sup></a>Some people believe that discussing legal matters should be reserved to people who are Law experts.
