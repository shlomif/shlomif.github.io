I too have read the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was too based on &#8220;feeling rather than knowing&#8221;. Joel later on posted many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people still recalled it as a very low-point in the blog.</p><p>Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles and essays about my thoughts, and this time I&#8217;ve decided to risk something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic: <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences of open-source software</a>. I&#8217;m going to introduce the various options, explain a little about their motivation and then give some advice according to my own personal opinion.</p><p id="ianal">I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according to my best knowledge, understanding and experience. <a href="#ftn.ianal" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[IANAL]</sup></a> I think what I&#8217;m writing here is correct, but would still appreciate any correction for future versions. If you&#8217;re unsure about my advice, then you should consult a legal expert (if you can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.</p><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="spoiler" class="title">Spoiler</h5><h:a class="indiv_node" href="indiv-nodes/spoiler.xhtml">Node Link</h:a></header><p>In this spoiler I&#8217;ll explain what I&#8217;m using right away, which is also what I recommend other people to use. When I started releasing my code as open-source software, I used <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the Public Domain</a>. So, for example, <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> which is one of my earliest projects and still one of the most successful, used to carry a <code class="filename">COPYING</code> file with the following contents:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Relax, this is not GPL software, but rather it is distributed under the public domain. It means it can be linked against anything, converted to any different license, freely used and distributed, and anything else without any restrictions whatsoever. No Strings Attached!&#8482;</p></blockquote></div><p>(This was also a joke of sorts.)</p><p>Later on, to avoid the problematic status of public domain code in many countries, and to avoid other potential legal problems, I started distributing my original code under <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_license">the MIT X11 Licence</a>, a permissive licence which is close to the Public Domain. If the project I&#8217;m contributing to has a different licence, then I disclaim any explicit or implicit ownership on the code I wrote, and allow the existing copyright holders to do with my code as they see fit.</p><p>Note that I&#8217;m using different terms for other types of digital artworks.

It doesn&#8217;t have the additional restrictions on licences compatibility that the GPL has, nor does it have the other obscure and not-well-understood restrictions that the GPL has.</p><p>I read the GPLv2 originally once and couldn&#8217;t understand it. The LGPLv2 or the GPLv3 would likely prove to be more problematic. I find it harder to trust lengthy documents that I am unable to understand. I had no problem understanding the Sleepycat licence, the Artistic 2.0 licence, or the MIT X11 and BSD licences, so I can better recommend them instead.</p><p>One fact I should note is that the GPL often stands against <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude">the Hacker&#8217;s attitude</a> as presented by Eric Raymond in <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">the document &#8220;How to become a Hacker&#8221;</a>.

I&#8217;d like to reply to it here.</p><p>Quoting from the comment:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>In the second half of the 90s, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X-Windows</a> was quite popular - a department (in universities, companies, etc.) would have strong Unix workstations (from Sun, DEC, SGI, HP and other vendors) and people would have cheaper machines showing the output from the strong machine using X-Windows. As MS-Windows grew popular, people wanted to use their PC running Windows to display X-Windows sessions. But unfortunately, the only X server available for Windows was commercial software (Exceed), which could happen because X was BSD-licensed and not GPL. Users (at the time, most had corporate or university funds - they weren&#8217;t home users) bit the bullet and paid. It took literally years before a free X server for Windows became available.</p></blockquote></div><p>My response is that this was indeed a problem and inconvenienced the users of Exceed. However, if X-Windows were GPLed, then the people who made Exceed and wanted to sell it, might not have made it in the first place, because they had to make it GPLed and keep it as FOSS. So either they would have implemented it from scratch or not at all. It is possible that a different group would have created a free X server for Windows, but it is possible that no free X server would have been available at all. And if a different group could have created a free X server for Windows without Exceed, they could have certainly created it with it.</p><p>Furthermore, If X11 had been initiated under a non-BSD-style-licence, then it is possible it would not have become as ubiquitous as it is in the UNIX world, thus making it irrelevant to port it to Windows in the first place. We can&#8217;t tell that for sure, but I think it is a possibility.</p><p>Quoting again:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>For example, someone integrated my <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver library</a> in a <a class="link" href="http://www.ambermango.com/php/am/f3d/index.php">shareware (without source) game he wrote titled Freecell 3D</a>.</p><p>He sells the game online. It did not do any damage, because there are plenty of Freecell implementations around. I on my part am pretty happy with the open-source PySolFC.</p></blockquote></div><p>Let&#8217;s imagine that you wrote a great Freecell solver library, but you suck at UI and failed to create a graphical game based on that library, and wish that someone created a UI on top of your library. If your library is BSD, someone could create this UI but make it commercial and not even you can use it. If your library is GPL, this person is forced to either make his code public (so you and your friends can use it) or pay you for a new license. Which of those scenarios will make you happier? I can&#8217;t see how the GPL isn&#8217;t better in this scenario.</p></blockquote></div><p>Well, first of all I should note that that is a lot of &#8220;if&#8221;&#8217;s. When I started working on Freecell Solver, there were already plenty of graphical Freecell games, possibly with support for other variants of Solitaire. And there were also several open-source ones, including some very polished ones.</p><p>As a result, I could have easily integrated my solver into one of them. So his thought experiment is not very realistic, although it may be valid in the general case.</p><p>Back to the thought experiment, a person who would be interested in creating a commercial Freecell UI and still integrate a solving mechanism to it could:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Develop his own Freecell solving library from scratch.

Back when I got my first computer - an 8088 PC XT with two 5.25" 360 KB diskette drives, and no hard disk, I started programming in BASIC - first the one that came on the BIOS and then BASIC.COM or GWBASIC. (BASICA wouldn&#8217;t run on my computer, for some reason). Back then, I programmed mostly games and my friends and I shared tips and programs between ourselves.</p><p>I took a long break from programming, and then started programming BASIC again - this time <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic">QBasic</a>. Then I got my father to buy a C compiler and he bought me Turbo C++, which I used for somewhat more &#8220;serious&#8221; stuff than BASIC (though I still used QBasic). Back then I wrote two libraries-of-sorts - called CCalc (for various mathematical routines) and CSee (for graphics) which I intended to distribute as shareware. I don&#8217;t recall if I planned to include the source.</p><p>I&#8217;ve now made them, and some other C code from that era, <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/open-source/nostalgia/">available as free and open source software under the Expat Licence</a>.</p><p>In any case, back then we were used to the fact that we have to pay for our software, so I probably thought that making these libraries public-domain was not worth it.</p><p>After I started getting into the world of UNIX, Linux, GNU, and open-source I realised there was a lot of software out there distributed with the source, which I could download and compile. I used to think of prep.ai.mit.edu (the old primary FTP host for gnu.org) as a cool collection of source code, which I could download, read the INSTALL file, build and install (sometimes after fixing the source). I wasn&#8217;t interested in the implications of its open source nature or the GPL licence. I also downloaded other software. I did know the software was gratis, as opposed to <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSQL">MiniSQL/mSQL</a> which was sourceware and shareware. That was good enough for me.</p><p>After I became more involved and started playing with Linux for developing software on it, I learned even more and understood what &#8220;free (as in speech) software&#8221; (or as it was later called &#8220;open-source software&#8221;) was all about. One thing I understood back then, was that it took me a long time to fully get to the bottom of all the GPL&#8217;s nuances, and that I thought the public domain was preferable, because I didn&#8217;t care too much about people changing the licence to something else, or using it in their own non-free/non-GPL-compatible software. A lot of people I have talked with since have shown many misunderstandings of the GPL.</p><p>In any case, I had initiated some FOSS projects under the public-domain which didn&#8217;t amount to a lot. I also wrote <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/grad-fu/">a patch for GIMP</a> which I made available, but has since then taken some other iterations and incarnations to be embedded. And then I released <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> (originally under the Public Domain - now MIT/Expat) and did a lot of extensive work on it, and then started some other moderately successful MIT/Expat projects, or contributed to or adopted FOSS projects under various licences.</p><p>So why am I still sticking with the MIT/Expat licence? The main reason I think is that as an open-source programmer, I&#8217;m not interested in worrying about how people abuse my code. I don&#8217;t like Apple, and am not fond of many Microsoft products. But I&#8217;m not interested to prevent Apple or Microsoft or any other developer of commercial and/or proprietary software for Windows or Mac OS X or the iPhone or whatever from using my code in their projects. In fact, I would prefer them to use my code than to create a proprietary replacement. Not to mention that making my code GPLed may also make it inappropriate for reuse by some developers of BSD software, for inclusion into the core BSD distributions, for some developers of non-GPL-compatible-but-still-open-source software, etc. I don&#8217;t want that - I want my code to be of the maximal use possible.</p><p>I should note that I&#8217;m more worried about my code being used for malicious purposes by evil governments, as I think no big corporation in history has been as abusive as some past and present governments that come to mind. But preventing internal use or &#8220;defence use&#8221; or government use or whatever will make it non-FOSS, (and non-GPL-compatible), not to mention that adding random restrictions (&#8220;cannot be used by Neonazis&#8221;, &#8220;cannot be used by terrorists&#8221;, &#8220;cannot be used by &#8216;Zionists&#8217;&#8221;, etc.) will fragment the software licensing world as a whole, and I would prefer not to open that Pandora Box.</p><p>Back to the topic: I don&#8217;t want to be bothered about legal issues with my software. If you want to use my code - use it. &#8220;Drive safely, the keys are inside.&#8221;. If you encounter any technical problems with the code (bugs, documentation issues, etc.) then I&#8217;d be interested to hear about them, because that will improve the quality of the product, which will hopefully make it even more successful. But I didn&#8217;t become a FOSS developer so I can sue people for violating the licences of my works. I have better things to do with my time, that bring me much more benefit.</p><p>Now, on to the issue of whether developing BSD-style code makes me a &#8220;sucker&#8221;. I covered it earlier in <a class="link" href="https://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/open-source/gpl-bsd-and-suckerism/">&#8220;The GPL, the BSD, and being a Sucker&#8221;</a> mini-essay.</p><p>To sum it up here, I don&#8217;t see why contributing to one&#8217;s neighbour (or the public at large), willingly and on one&#8217;s free time (which may be called &#8220;donation&#8221;, &#8220;philanthropy&#8221; or even &#8220;altruism&#8221;) and for a non-harmful cause can be considered as being a &#8220;sucker&#8221;. Everybody is able to use GPLed software of various originators too free-of-charge or put it into good use in many legal and legitimate ways and yet you don&#8217;t hear that often that people who develop GPLed software are &#8220;suckers&#8221;.</p><p>I don&#8217;t see myself as a sucker just by allowing third-parties (whether individuals, corporations, governments or any other organisations) to use my software in non-free contexts, and don&#8217;t think anyone should say that the GPL is the &#8220;don&#8217;t-be-a-sucker&#8221; licence because BSD-style licences are by implications &#8220;be-a-sucker&#8221; licence. I hate selfishness. (And I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;rational self-growth&#8221; or acting-out-of-one&#8217;s-own-best-self-interest, which is what Ayn Rand meant in the book <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtue_of_Selfishness"><span class="emphasis"><em>The Virtue of Selfishness</em></span></a> - I discuss it in the link briefly).</p><p>Another argument that you can often hear against the BSDL was that the Linux kernel was more successful than the BSDs due to its GPLed licence. However, this is:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist compact"><li class="listitem"><p>A <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post_hoc_ergo_propter_hoc">post-hoc fallacy</a> - just because Linux is more successful than the BSDs, doesn&#8217;t mean that the licence was the main reason for it, or the only reason.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>In accordance to #1 - may be attributed to other factors such as Linus Torvalds&#8217; leadership skills, the kernel&#8217;s adoption of the Bazaar-style of development, the willingness of Linux distributions to use the GNU project&#8217;s software by default as run-time, <a class="link" href="https://libquotes.com/linus-torvalds/quote/lbi7o4k">the cooler name</a>, the lack of initial legal limbo that the BSDs had, etc. etc.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>One can find examples to projects in other niches that have been very successful despite their permissive licences - Apache, X-Windows, SQLite, PostgreSQL, Python, libxml2, OpenSSH, etc. So extrapolating from one instance (the kernel) to everything is not scientific.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>The BSD-based kernels and operating systems are doing fine, despite not being as popular as Linux. Often, people use code from efforts by BSD developers in Linux (e.g: OpenSSH or some of the OpenBSD wireless drivers that were adapted and integrated into the Linux kernel). So it&#8217;s not as if, they have completely &#8220;lost&#8221;.</p></li></ol></div><p>While I&#8217;m still using GNU/Linux (Mandriva Linux Cooker in my case) because that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ve grown accustomed to using, I would still like to play with some BSD derivatives and OpenSolaris. I&#8217;m also not planning on switching to gNewSense or one of the Free Software Foundation&#8217;s endorsed &#8220;100% Free Distributions&#8221;, because Mandriva is free enough for me.</p><p>To sum up, I&#8217;m not trying to dissuade you from licensing your software under weak copyleft or strong copyleft licences, but I&#8217;m still happy with my code being BSD-style. I&#8217;m glad to learn of any use someone has been making of it, and in the few times it has been used in commercial or proprietary contexts, it did not make me regret that I released it as FOSS. I hadn&#8217;t wanted it to be an issue in the first place, and so it wasn&#8217;t. <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hakuna_matata"><span class="strong"><strong>Hakuna Matata</strong></span></a>.</p></section><div id="acknowledgements" class="acknowledgements"><p>Special thanks to <a class="link" href="http://migo.sixbit.org/about/">Mikhael Goikhman</a> who pointed several factual mistakes in an earlier revision of this essay.</p></div><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr class="footnote-hr"/><div id="ftn.ianal" class="footnote"><p><a href="#ianal" class="para"><sup class="para">[IANAL] </sup></a>Some people believe that discussing legal matters should be reserved to people who are Law experts.
