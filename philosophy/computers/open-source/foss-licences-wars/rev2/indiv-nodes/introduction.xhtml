I too have read the post, and agreed, that while it had a few good points, it was too based on &#8220;feeling rather than knowing&#8221;. Joel later on posted many good articles and shorter entries on his blog, but many people still recalled it as a very low-point in the blog.</p><p>Like Joel, I have a home-site and several blogs, where I post articles and essays about my thoughts, and this time I&#8217;ve decided to risk something similar to what Joel has done on an equally flamatory topic: <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software_licence">licences of open-source software</a>. I&#8217;m going to introduce the various options, explain a little about their motivation and then give some advice according to my own personal opinion.</p><p id="ianal">I should note that I am not a lawyer, and only write this according to my best knowledge, understanding and experience. <a href="../#ftn.ianal" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[IANAL]</sup></a> I think what I&#8217;m writing here is correct, but would still appreciate any correction for future versions. If you&#8217;re unsure about my advice, then you should consult a legal expert (if you can afford one) or your local or global Free and Open Source Software organisation. I cannot guarantee my advice is valid.</p><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="spoiler" class="title">Spoiler</h5></header><p>In this spoiler I&#8217;ll explain what I&#8217;m using right away, which is also what I recommend other people to use. When I started releasing my code as open-source software, I used <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain">the Public Domain</a>. So, for example, <a class="link" href="http://fc-solve.shlomifish.org/">Freecell Solver</a> which is one of my earliest projects and still one of the most successful, used to carry a <code class="filename">COPYING</code> file with the following contents:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Relax, this is not GPL software, but rather it is distributed under the public domain. It means it can be linked against anything, converted to any different license, freely used and distributed, and anything else without any restrictions whatsoever. No Strings Attached!&#8482;</p></blockquote></div><p>(This was also a joke of sorts.)</p><p>Later on, to avoid the problematic status of public domain code in many countries, and to avoid other potential legal problems, I started distributing my original code under <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X11_license">the MIT X11 Licence</a>, a permissive licence which is close to the Public Domain. If the project I&#8217;m contributing to has a different licence, then I disclaim any explicit or implicit ownership on the code I wrote, and allow the existing copyright holders to do with my code as they see fit.</p><p>Note that I&#8217;m using different terms for other types of digital artworks. Most of my essays (including this one) are under the <a class="link" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution Licence</a>, my original (i.e: non-derived-work or fan-art) fictitious stories are often under <a class="link" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike Licence</a> or <a class="link" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/">Creative Commons &#8212; Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike</a> (which is more GPL-like), and most of the photos I took and published were placed under the Public Domain.</p></section></section></main>
