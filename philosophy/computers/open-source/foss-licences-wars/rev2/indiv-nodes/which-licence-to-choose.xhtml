I&#8217;ll start with some bad ideas of what not to do.</p><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="which-licence-non-open-source" class="title">Bad Idea No. 1: Choose a non-Open-Source Licence</h5></header><p>Well, I&#8217;m not sure it is a bad idea, but choosing a licence for a non-FOSS program is out of the scope for this document. I&#8217;m not going to stop you from trying, but neither can I help you with the licence choice. My best advice is to consult a lawyer.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="which-licence-non-gpl-compatible" class="title">Bad Idea No. 2: Choose a non-GPL-Compatible Licence</h5></header><p>David A. Wheeler <a class="link" href="http://www.dwheeler.com/essays/gpl-compatible.html">wrote about why it is important to pick a GPL-compatible licence for one&#8217;s software project</a>.</p><p>Now, since version 2 of the GPL is incompatible with version 3, and vice-versa (due to the additional restrictions imposed by version 3) you shouldn&#8217;t choose GPLv2-only or GPLv3-only or GPLv3-and-above, because some projects may be licensed only under one of them. Also, the version 3 of the LGPL is incompatible with the GPLv2, so you shouldn&#8217;t choose it either. GPL-version-2-or-above or LGPL-version-2.1-or-above should be OK in this respect.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="which-licence-custom" class="title">Bad Idea No. 3: Choose a Custom Licence</h5></header><p>You shouldn&#8217;t phrase your own licence and hope it will be considered open-source and GPL-compatible as there are plenty of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FSF_approved_software_licences">open-source licences</a> to choose from. Creating your own licence may put your users and you under risk of abuse and will contribute to the problem of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_proliferation">licence proliferation</a>, and may confuse your users who will need to read your unusual licence in order to study it.</p><p>Using your own custom licence deprives you of the benefit of using a well-reviewed, well-understood and debugged licence. This is similar to writing your own program from scratch instead of using an existing, well-tested software solution that already provides that functionality. (Thanks to Omer Zak for this analogy.)</p><p>So, don&#8217;t do that.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="which-licence-same-as-perl" class="title">Bad Idea No. 4: &#8220;Same Terms as Perl&#8221;</h5></header><p>I originally <a class="link" href="http://use.perl.org/~Shlomi+Fish/journal/36050">wrote about the problem of saying your code is &#8220;licensed under the same terms as Perl itself&#8221;</a> (which is prevalent for <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPAN">CPAN</a> modules and other Perl code) on my Perl blog. It was also <a class="link" href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/04/the-problem-with-same-terms-as-perl-licensing.html">covered on Perlbuzz</a> and <a class="link" href="http://perlbuzz.com/2009/07/help-end-licensing-under-same-terms-as-perl-itself.html">covered there again</a>. I&#8217;m only going to summarise these arguments here, and conclude by saying that using the Artistic License Version 2.0 or later, or a GPL-compatible permissive licence, such as the MIT/Expat License, would be preferable.</p><p id="Perl5_vs_Raku">Essentially, the licence of perl (the Perl 5 implementation) <a href="../#ftn.Perl5_vs_Raku" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[Perl 5]</sup></a> has changed several times since its inception - from a non-free licence, to the GPL, to a dual GPL and Artistic licensing. Furthermore, the Artistic license is not considered free and GPL compatible by the Free Software Foundation, so it&#8217;s not a wise choice, and the GPL has its share of problems too (see below) so it&#8217;s not a wise choice either.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="which-licence-public-domain" class="title">Bad Idea No. 5: Under the Public Domain</h5></header><p>It is not wise to licence one&#8217;s code under the Public Domain because the Public Domain is not widely understood or accepted internationally, and because licensing code under the Public Domain may not be possible. <a class="link" href="http://linuxmafia.com/kb/Licensing_and_Law/">Rick Moen gives more reasons under &#8220;Public Domain&#8221; in the Licensing and Law section of his knowledge base.</a></p><p>If you&#8217;re interested in making your software as-close-to-PD-as-possible, you should choose the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License">MIT/Expat Licence</a> or a similar licence such as <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license">the ISC licence.</a></p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="which-licence-gpl-or-lgpl" class="title">Bad Idea No. 6: Using the GPL or the LGPL</h5></header><p>The GNU General Public Licence (GPL) and GNU Lesser General Public Licence (LGPL) contain many additional restrictions to the concept of copyleft, and are very misunderstood, over-hyped, and don&#8217;t maintain compatibility with newer versions. Even <a class="link" href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.642822.36">the LGPL is reportedly problematic</a></p><p>The GPL and LGPL are of more political nature than other similar FOSS licences, and as such should be avoided. I recommend using the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleepycat_License">Sleepycat licence</a>, which is a strong-copyleft licence, that is compatible with GPLv2 and above, instead of the GPL and the <a class="link" href="../#MozillaPL">MPL</a> 2.0 (or above) licence instead of the LGPL. Naturally, permissive, non-copyleft, open-source licences such as the MIT Expat Licence are an option. What the Sleepycat licence says is that code distributed under it, must remain under it, and that one must release the source code for publicly-distributed binaries that link against it. However, from my understanding, as opposed to the GPL, this source code doesn&#8217;t have to be completely free. It doesn&#8217;t have the additional restrictions on licences compatibility that the GPL has, nor does it have the other obscure and not-well-understood restrictions that the GPL has.</p><p>I read the GPLv2 originally once and couldn&#8217;t understand it. The LGPLv2 or the GPLv3 would likely prove to be more problematic. I find it harder to trust lengthy documents that I am unable to understand. I had no problem understanding the Sleepycat licence, the Artistic 2.0 licence, or the MIT X11 and BSD licences, so I can better recommend them instead.</p><p>One fact I should note is that the GPL often stands against <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html#attitude">the Hacker&#8217;s attitude</a> as presented by Eric Raymond in <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">the document &#8220;How to become a Hacker&#8221;</a>. It states that:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>The world is full of fascinating problems waiting to be solved.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>No problem should ever have to be solved twice.</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><p>For example, the Free Software Foundation now started the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_PDF">GNU PDF project</a> that is licensed under the GPL version 3, because all the other Free software PDF projects are GPL version 2 only. So because the GPL was used, the same problem need to be solved twice.</p><p>Another case where it happened was <a class="link" href="http://www.osnews.com/story/7241">this story of an the Inkscape set operations patch</a>:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Once before, someone had contributed a patch to add boolean operations, but that patch relied on a polygon clipping library provided under an incompatible license. There&#8217;s little more frustrating than having a solution in hand, only to be hamstrung by legal problems. Even though it was an important feature for us, we regretfully postponed development of it into the distant future on our roadmap and proceeded with other work.</p></blockquote></div><p>Furthermore, the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenBSD">OpenBSD</a> project are now re-implementing a lot of software that is only available as GPL or similar licences, under BSD-style licences, due to OpenBSD&#8217;s stricter licensing policy.</p><p>And finally, often one can build upon non-GPL-like-code and not release the derived work as free and open source software, without it causing any harm, and actually causing a lot of good. Which is otherwise prevented if the code is GPLed.</p></section><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr class="footnote-hr"/><div id="ftn.Perl5_vs_Raku" class="footnote"><p><a href="../#Perl5_vs_Raku" class="para"><sup class="para">[Perl 5] </sup></a>Perl 1-to-5 is not to be confused with <a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raku_(programming_language)">"Raku", which was formerly called "Perl 6"</a>.</p></div></div></section></main>
