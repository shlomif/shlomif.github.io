However, one can <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker">link</a> to weak copyleft code from code under a different licence (including non-open-source code), or otherwise incorporate it in a larger software.</p><p>Otherwise, weak copyleft licences allow free distribution, use , selling copies of the code or the binaries (as long as the binaries are accompanied by the (unobfuscated) source code), etc.</p><p>Examples of weak copyleft licences include:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License">The GNU Lesser General Public Licence (or LGPL for short)</a> - this licence was formulated by the <a class="link" href="http://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a> based on the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License">GNU General Public Licence (or GPL)</a>. Its text is longer than the GPL, and it is reportedly a more complicated licence. Other than the general &#8220;you-can-link-it-against-everything-as-long-as-you-keep-inclusive-code-LGPLed&#8221;, it allows an explicit conversion to the GPL, has patent-related clauses, and contains many additional restrictions.</p><p>Version 2 of the LGPL was succeeded by version 2.1, and now there&#8217;s also version 3 which is based on a short adaptation of the version 3 of the GPL (see below).</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artistic_License">Version 2.0 of the Artistic Licence</a>, which was formulated by the Perl foundation is used by <a class="link" href="http://www.parrot.org/">the Parrot Virtual Machine</a>, some Perl 6 implementations, and other projects. The original Artistic Licence has problematic phrasing, and is not recommended for general use, unless possibly when dually licensed with a different licence (as is the case for perl 5 and many Perl modules on the CPAN).</p><p>The Artistic Licence version 2 is relatively short and easy to digest. One note about it is that it allows distributing binaries that were derived from a modified source, without the obligation to release the modifications of the source. However, if one wishes to distribute a modified source, he must make his modifications under the same licence.</p><p>An anecdote about this licence is that it <a class="link" href="http://perlbuzz.com/2008/02/rem-releases-videos-under-artistic-license-20.html">was chosen by R.E.M for licensing some video-clips</a> from one of their albums.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Public_License">The Mozilla Public Licence (or MPL)</a> was phrased for the public source release of the <a class="link" href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla project</a>. It was characterised as a hybridisation of the modified BSD licence and the GPL. This licence was ruled as GPL-incompatible, which eventually caused the Mozilla project to re-license its code under a triple MPL, GPL and LGPL licence. This is still the licensing terms of Mozilla projects such as <a class="link" href="http://www.getfirefox.com/">the Firefox web-browser</a> up to today.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><span class="bold"><strong>GPL with an Exemption Clause</strong></span> - the GPL is a <a class="link" href="../#strong-copyleft-licences" title="Strong Copyleft Licences">strong copy-left licence</a>, but sometimes an additional clause is added that allows it to be linked against code of non-GPL-compatible licences (including non-open-source code). This strategy was chosen by Sun Microsystems when they decided to release <a class="link" href="http://www.java.com/">the source of the Java programming language</a> under an open-source licence.</p></li></ol></div></section></main>
