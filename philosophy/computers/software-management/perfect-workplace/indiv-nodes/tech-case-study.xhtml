Then I received a phone call from them that they want me to come and install Fedora Linux on the computer. I did that, and next thing I knew, I was given other tasks.</p><p>I was instructed to write a mail-processing framework in PHP. Now since I know and love Perl, I know there are many fine modules for doing that on <a class="link" href="http://sial.org/howto/perl/life-with-cpan/">CPAN (= The Comprehensive Perl Archive Network)</a>, but there was little of substantial quality for PHP. At a certain time I needed to register at a site, to download the latest version of a PHP library, that was free software, because the download required authentication. There didn't seem to be anything better.</p><p>I was told that they would prefer to write everything in PHP, because they expected to hire only PHP programmers, possibly without any Perl experience.</p><p>That wasn't all. They also decided against using <a class="link" href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>, which is a modern, high-performance and open-source SMTP server, and instead preferred the old Sendmail SMTP server which has a far worse reputation, and an arcane configuration system.</p><p>Furthermore, they also decided to use MySQL instead of PostgreSQL, and we ran into a PHP misbehaviour (which was fixable given a lot of PHP know-how) that made us have to restart the connection to the server after every request. Both MySQL and Sendmail were chosen from political reasons.</p><p>With my PHP code barely working and prune to many errors, I decided to quit after about a month, out of being appalled by the bad code craftsmanship I could do there. Make sure you don't repeat such a mistake.</p></section></main>
