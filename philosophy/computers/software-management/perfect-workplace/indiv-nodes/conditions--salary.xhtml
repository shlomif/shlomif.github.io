Yes, it's important, but not absolutely everything. Great programmers won't work for you for free, but they'll find many other conditions much more tempting than an over-blown salary. See what <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s19.html">Eric Raymond wrote about it in "Homesteading the Noosphere"</a>, quoting many studies:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Psychologist Theresa Amabile of Brandeis University, cautiously summarizing the results of a 1984 study of motivation and reward, observed ``It may be that commissioned work will, in general, be less creative than work that is done out of pure interest.''. Amabile goes on to observe that ``The more complex the activity, the more it's hurt by extrinsic reward.'' Interestingly, the studies suggest that flat salaries don't demotivate, but piecework rates and bonuses do.</p><p>Thus, it may be economically smart to give performance bonuses to people who flip burgers or dug ditches, but it's probably smarter to decouple salary from performance in a programming shop and let people choose their own projects (both trends that the open-source world takes to their logical conclusions). Indeed, these results suggest that the only time it is a good idea to reward performance in programming is when the programmer is so motivated that he or she would have worked without the reward!</p></blockquote></div></section></main>
