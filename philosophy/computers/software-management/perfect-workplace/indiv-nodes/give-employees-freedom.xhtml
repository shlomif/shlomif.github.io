If he isn't, then no amount of watching will make him responsible.</p><p>You shouldn't constantly monitor your employees. Instead, give them time to clear their mind and do non-coding-related activities such as:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Play computer games.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Browse the web.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Watch videos or listen to netcasts.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Read articles or books.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Work on open-source software or their own personal projects.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Chat with their co-workers or online peers.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Take walks in the neighbourhood, do sports, go to clubs and other activities.</p></li></ol></div><p>These tasks and others don't interfere with the work much, and actually contribute to productivity. And along with <a class="link" href="../perfect-it-workplace.xhtml#pair-programming" title="Pair Programming">pair programming</a>, you can be more certain your programmers will work. Don't judge your employees by how they spend their time at work - instead judge them by the overall progress they do in the long run.</p><p>Moreover, some tasks that your employees do at their free time, may eventually bring your company publicity and esteem. Part of the reason Joel Spolsky's <a class="link" href="http://www.fogcreek.com/">"Fog Creek Software" company</a> is so well-known is because of the <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/">Joel on Software</a> blog, which is one of the most-read weblogs about software management. This in turn resulted in a lot of publicity to the Fog Creek products.</p><p id="eric-sink-scrabble">If your employees are productive, you should not really be concerned what they are doing on their work time.<a href="../perfect-it-workplace.xhtml#ftn.eric-sink-scrabble" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[EricSink]</sup></a> Google allows its employees work on non-work-related-tasks 20% of the time (while Google still owns the intellectual rights to their creations). I would go a step further by saying you simply should allow your employees to do as much non-work-related leisure as they feel they need to on their working hours. Tell them you expect long-term results, not 100% productivity-of-time.</p></section></main>
