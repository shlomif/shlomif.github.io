Take <a class="link" href="http://groups.google.com/group/israelrb/browse_frm/thread/bb11cf1c3ed8e221">this job ad that was posted to the Israeli Ruby mailing list</a> for an excellent example:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>We are looking for a developer who:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p>Want a full time, salaried position.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Want to work in a fun, young workplace.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Want to work in an environment that allows them to use (just about) whatever tools they wish to get the job done.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Knows and love Ruby.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Ideally have experience with PHP and Python.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Want to work on large scale Rails/Merb projects that have nothing to do with "the Social Web".</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Want to drown a puppy every time they hear phrases like "the Social Web".</p></li></ul></div></blockquote></div><p>See? I also want to write sites that are not necessarily "Social Web", and I also got tired of the "Social Web" and its association with Ruby and other similar technologies. So this ad has caught my attention.</p><p id="linux-systems">As <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LordPalmerston.html">Joel on Software notes about experience</a>, the reason companies want people with a lot of experience in a certain niche, is because they tend to overcome problems they encounter more easily and so can help themselves and their co-workers with their problem more easily.<a href="../perfect-it-workplace.xhtml#ftn.linux-systems" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[Linux-Systems-Programming]</sup></a></p><p>However, as long as you have someone with enough experience, then bright people without a lot of experience can still prove to be useful and very productive. So don't demand too much from them. As of 2008, there aren't enough clueful developers in Israel for all the workplaces (and I think that's also the case in most other places), and you can't afford to be too picky.</p><p>Another tip I can offer to look for employees is to use specialised job boards like the <a class="link" href="http://jobs.joelonsoftware.com/">the Joel on Software job-board</a>, and <a class="link" href="http://jobs.perl.org/">jobs.perl.org</a>, <a class="link" href="http://jobs.thedailywtf.com/1001/browse.aspx">the DailyWTF "Non-WTF" board</a> which highly-qualified and niche people follow. Just make sure to phrase your ad in a non-boring way, as I noted earlier.</p></section></main>
