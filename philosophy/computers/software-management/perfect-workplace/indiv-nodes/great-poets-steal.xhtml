It is perfectly OK to create a product in <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000056.html">a niche which has a lot of existing competition</a>, it's OK to build on other people's efforts, and it's OK to "borrow" or "steal" (see the quote at the top) ideas from your users, competitors and friends.</p><p>You're not getting credit for originality - you're getting credit for high-quality products (software, services, support, etc. - whatever you do) and especially for revenue and profits. See <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000074.html">"Converting Capital into Software That Works" for more information</a></p><p>Another common fallacy is that ideas are the hardest part of the production process. However, ideas are very cheap, and creative people have far too many good ideas. It's actually harder to develop the idea into a product, to mass-produce it, and then to mass-distribute it. Edison was not the first to come up with the Electrical Lightbulb, or to develop a working prototype, but he was the one to have put up all the effort in making it so popular and prevalent. Therefore, he is rightly credited as its inventor.</p><p>Similar in software, you can often see competing products displacing more established competition, or sometimes a market where there isn't a clear winner (e.g: <a class="link" href="http://xwinman.org/">window managers and desktop environments for Unix</a>, Bug trackers, text editors, etc.)</p><p id="ideas-at-the-same-time">Even making rounder wheels is a good way to earn a living and to get respect.<a href="../perfect-it-workplace.xhtml#ftn.ideas-at-the-same-time" class="footnote"><sup class="footnote">[Ideas]</sup></a></p></section></main>
