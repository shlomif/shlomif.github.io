So I argue you as a manager or an employee to read as much different material you can find. There's a lot of good advice out there. Socrates said: "I know that I do not know.", and he was right.</p><p>While it's easy to dismiss other people as "idiots" or what they say as being "stupid", one should realise that even incorrect conclusions or reasoning can bring useful insights, and give some food for thought. Sometimes, I find some useful insights in rehearsed things or short blog entries.</p><p>If you're a manager or team-leader, you should make sure that you're not much more clue-less than your programmers are, but that has often been the case for me and others.</p></section></main>
