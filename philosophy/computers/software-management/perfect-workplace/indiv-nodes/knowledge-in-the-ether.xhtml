Quoting from my original post:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>One anti-pattern I noted in a previous workplace was what I called "Knowledge in the Ether": most of the instructions for getting the application up and running, and a lot of the collective knowledge were not written down in a collective place. TDDPirate said he was familiar with it and called it the <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oral_Torah">"Oral Torah"</a> syndrome.</p><p>The solution for this is simple: set up a wiki for the company, and instruct people to write a note there whenever they need to explain to someone how to do it (or give a link to a previous note), <span class="bold"><strong>instead of</strong></span> guiding him how to do it. While this requires some discipline and getting used to, it can also be done after the fact.</p><p>Obviously the amount of knowledge in people's head and in the Ether can never be completely eliminated. But it should be kept down to a minimum.</p></blockquote></div><p>There was also a comment that said one should write a script to do that. And it's a good idea to keep good README files, comments, etc. and to use a standard building procedure, or prepare distribution-level packages for the software.</p><p>Nevertheless, a workplace should encourage its employees to note down every useful knowledge and procedure. My friend once told me that in his previous workplace they kept a knowledge-base as a group of Microsoft Word documents stored inside Visual SourceSafe. As a result, people felt it was too much bother to update and maintain them. Eventually, he set up an instance of <a class="link" href="http://www.mediawiki.org/">MediaWiki</a> there, which proved to be much more convenient, accessible and quick.</p></section></main>
