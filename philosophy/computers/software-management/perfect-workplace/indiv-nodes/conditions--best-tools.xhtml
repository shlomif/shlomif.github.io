As <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Spolsky notes</a> (based on Steve McConnell) in item No. 9 of the Joel Test, you need to "use the best tools that money can buy".</p><p>If you buy old, broken and/or barely functioning hardware, you'll spend a lot of time debugging the problems there, which will waste a lot of precious time. And you may lose a lot of reputation and customers due to down-time. <span class="bold"><strong>Relying on reliable, high-end hardware</strong></span> is a much better idea.</p><p>I've been to two workplaces that gave me an old computer with a 40 GB hard-disk. It wasn't enough at all. At one place, we've reached the limit of this hard-disk due to several large source code checkouts, and as a result needed a bigger hard-disk. And the only hard-disks the lab had were 80 GB ones, which were bought because they were the cheapest (per-disk, not per-capacity). Please, <span class="bold"><strong>buy large enough hard-disks</strong></span>.</p><p>At the same workplace, I was given a computer with a read-only CD-ROM drive. It was not even a DVD reader. I brought a DVD of audio files from home, and could not read it. In this day and age, read/write DVD drives are the standard, and are ultra-cheap.</p><p>Sometimes you'll need <span class="bold"><strong>several computers</strong></span>, or a decent <span class="bold"><strong>virtual machine emulator</strong></span>, to run alternative operating systems on the same machine.</p><p>Make sure your workers have a <span class="bold"><strong>high-quality screen</strong></span>. They need to look at it most of the day, and they want it to look nice. A decent 19" LCD screen nowadays is very cheap nowadays and well worth the added productivity.</p><p>You also need a <a class="link" href="http://better-scm.shlomifish.org/">state-of-the-art version control system</a> , of which there are currently several high-quality open-source alternatives. Some very costly version control systems have a bad reputation for being extreme troublemakers, while the modern open-source alternatives "just work".</p><p>If there's a good commercial software that your employees like to use and can recommend, don't hesitate to buy it. You'll also find <a class="link" href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Safari</a> Licences to be a good idea so your employees can easily look up and read information in many books online.</p></section></main>
