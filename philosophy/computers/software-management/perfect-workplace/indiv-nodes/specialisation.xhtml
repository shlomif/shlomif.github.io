Taken to extreme, however, such a trend is very dangerous.</p><p>Programmers need to have a solid understanding of the entire product stack in their head. Good programmers can also benefit from a change of scenery. And naturally, <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review">reviewing someone else's code</a>, and criticising it, is also always beneficial.</p><p>Therefore, you should make sure that your workers don't over-specialise. Let them dedicate some time to work on what they find interesting, and let them review and criticise other people's work.</p><p>Once, before I started my undergraduate studies, I worked for a developer of a software-based modem (so-called "Winmodems"). I was impressed from the atmosphere there, and how professional and clueful the managers were. One of the things I liked about the job was that while I was initially hired as a tester, I eventually was appreciated for my eclectic knowledge of different aspects of sound, games, modems, Internet, and other fields. So, I was given more diverse things to do there, involving many aspects of our operation.</p><p>You should follow suit and involve your star developers in as many aspects of your development.</p></section></main>
