At one of my workplace, I constantly had to move to let other people out of their seats, and this was unbearable. So don't do that.</p><p>In one job that I fondly remember, every employee had their own spacious cube, with a desk to put a computer and a place to put a few chairs. This was much more like it.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="conditions--best-tools" class="title">The Best Tools That Money Can Buy</h5></header><p>This cannot stressed enough. As <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html">Joel Spolsky notes</a> (based on Steve McConnell) in item No. 9 of the Joel Test, you need to "use the best tools that money can buy".</p><p>If you buy old, broken and/or barely functioning hardware, you'll spend a lot of time debugging the problems there, which will waste a lot of precious time. And you may lose a lot of reputation and customers due to down-time. <span class="bold"><strong>Relying on reliable, high-end hardware</strong></span> is a much better idea.</p><p>I've been to two workplaces that gave me an old computer with a 40 GB hard-disk. It wasn't enough at all. At one place, we've reached the limit of this hard-disk due to several large source code checkouts, and as a result needed a bigger hard-disk. And the only hard-disks the lab had were 80 GB ones, which were bought because they were the cheapest (per-disk, not per-capacity). Please, <span class="bold"><strong>buy large enough hard-disks</strong></span>.</p><p>At the same workplace, I was given a computer with a read-only CD-ROM drive. It was not even a DVD reader. I brought a DVD of audio files from home, and could not read it. In this day and age, read/write DVD drives are the standard, and are ultra-cheap.</p><p>Sometimes you'll need <span class="bold"><strong>several computers</strong></span>, or a decent <span class="bold"><strong>virtual machine emulator</strong></span>, to run alternative operating systems on the same machine.</p><p>Make sure your workers have a <span class="bold"><strong>high-quality screen</strong></span>. They need to look at it most of the day, and they want it to look nice. A decent 19" LCD screen nowadays is very cheap nowadays and well worth the added productivity.</p><p>You also need a <a class="link" href="http://better-scm.shlomifish.org/">state-of-the-art version control system</a> , of which there are currently several high-quality open-source alternatives. Some very costly version control systems have a bad reputation for being extreme troublemakers, while the modern open-source alternatives "just work".</p><p>If there's a good commercial software that your employees like to use and can recommend, don't hesitate to buy it. You'll also find <a class="link" href="http://safari.oreilly.com/">O'Reilly Safari</a> Licences to be a good idea so your employees can easily look up and read information in many books online.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="conditions--sane-working-hours" class="title">Sane Working Hours</h5></header><p>Give your employees <a class="link" href="http://www.igda.org/articles/erobinson_crunch.php">sane working hours</a> - 40 hours work-weeks or less. While sometimes asking them to stay late to finish a deadline is acceptable, the so-called "crunch mode" is under-effective and a recipe for disaster.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="conditions--location" class="title">Location, Location, Location</h5></header><p>Find a good place which is close enough for most people to get to. Make sure your programmers can commute to you easily. Even pay for taxi-cabs out of your own expense, or ask other employees to give them a ride, if there isn't good public transportation. The money you spend on the cabs is very small compared to the one you would lose by lost productivity, and by frustrations of travelling.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="conditions--paid-vacation" class="title">A Lot of Paid Vacation</h5></header><p>Give your workers a lot of paid vacation. Humans are not machines - they need rest and relaxation. The 14 annual vacation days mandated by the Israeli government are a joke. You should give them much more than that. Joel Spolsky's Fog Creek software gives 6 weeks of paid vacation, which is much more reasonable.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="conditions--strict-firewalls" class="title">Avoid Over-Strict Firewalls</h5></header><p>Some organisations put their intranets below firewalls that block access to almost all services. It is not uncommon to see only the HTTP and HTTPS ports open for free access.</p><p>However, there are many other Internet services that star programmers need in order to be productive. Among them are:</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">Internet Relay Chat</a> and other forms of <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instant_messaging">Instant Messaging</a>. This allows star programmers to discuss problems and share solutions interactively with their peers, or just to take a break from work and chat.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://www.openssh.org/">SSH - Secure Shell</a> - allows access to remote computers over the network.</p></li><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)">BitTorrent</a> - allows downloading some content that is otherwise not available on the Web.</p></li></ol></div><p>And naturally, malware can easily propagate and survive using HTTP and HTTPS alone, and there are ways that clueful workers can overcome such restrictions.</p><p>At one of my workplaces, I was able to chat on the IRC, connect using IM, ssh to everywhere I wanted, etc. without any restriction. It was a liberating feeling and I felt at home there. At a more recent one, I needed to connect to a remote host, and invoke port forwarding in order to talk on the IRC which was annoying and error prone.</p><p>So make sure your firewall is not over-zealous and does not prevent legitimate uses.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="conditions--salary" class="title">About the Salary</h5></header><p>Competitive Salary? Yes, it's important, but not absolutely everything. Great programmers won't work for you for free, but they'll find many other conditions much more tempting than an over-blown salary. See what <a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/ar01s19.html">Eric Raymond wrote about it in "Homesteading the Noosphere"</a>, quoting many studies:</p><div class="blockquote"><blockquote class="blockquote"><p>Psychologist Theresa Amabile of Brandeis University, cautiously summarizing the results of a 1984 study of motivation and reward, observed ``It may be that commissioned work will, in general, be less creative than work that is done out of pure interest.''. Amabile goes on to observe that ``The more complex the activity, the more it's hurt by extrinsic reward.'' Interestingly, the studies suggest that flat salaries don't demotivate, but piecework rates and bonuses do.</p><p>Thus, it may be economically smart to give performance bonuses to people who flip burgers or dug ditches, but it's probably smarter to decouple salary from performance in a programming shop and let people choose their own projects (both trends that the open-source world takes to their logical conclusions). Indeed, these results suggest that the only time it is a good idea to reward performance in programming is when the programmer is so motivated that he or she would have worked without the reward!</p></blockquote></div></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="conditions--conclusion" class="title">Conditions: Conclusion</h5></header><p>One final note: you might thing to yourself: <span class="bold"><strong>"how can I afford all that?"</strong></span>. Well, the answer is that the cost of all these advantages is very small in comparison to your general operation. And they will pay themselves much more as time goes by in the happiness, productivity and loyalty of your workers.</p><p>The last thing you want is to lose a competent developer. And all these things will better make sure that he or she will stay with you.</p></section></section></main>
