Some people who commented on the article found it of good value. However many people who commented on it have voiced some criticism.</p><p>One of the comments I received said that I kept giving bad examples for conditions I disliked from previous workplaces, instead of positive elements I would have liked to see or have seen. As much as I like liquidating negatives, I agree that I should also mention some good things that a workplace needs to adopt.</p><p>Another commenter told me in private, that he felt that the “End of IT Slavery” and other essays of mine reflected the fact that I had a “primadonna attitude” instead of a more positive “team-player” attitude. While this may be deduced from my “The End of IT Slavery”, I found that as a tech worker, I tended to just get my job done as I told, try to be as productive as I can be, try to adjust to the surroundings, and even be a little <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/12/06.html">of what Israelis call “rosh qatan” (= “small-head”)</a></p><p>I can see why people would think so after reading the “End of IT Slavery”. However, my intention in the article was to guide employers (and employees) as to how to best treat their employees, and give them good conditions, so they’ll be happier and more productive. Going over the original article, I can see that I indeed had a very ranting tone, and had given bad examples for what not to do, exclusively.</p><p>So this time, I’m going to try again and hopefully be more successful. This article aims to cover the elements that <a class="link" href="http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html">great programmers</a> would love to see in a perfect workplace. By implementing as many of them as possible, or at least giving them a serious thought, you can make such potential employees want to work for you, love to work for you, want to stay, and be happy as long as they are working for you. Furthermore, you will know better than to irrationally fire perfectly good employees.</p><p>I’m not trying to be original in this article, because an essayist (or any kind of artist) does not get credit for coming up with perfectly original concepts or ideas (as <a class="link" href="#great-poets-steal" title="“Good Poets Borrow. Great Poets Steal.”">I note later</a> in a different context). What I’m trying to do is summarise everything I’ve learned, judged and concluded, so far, based on the many sources I’ve read. I may be just a dwarf standing on the shoulders of giant, but hopefully I’ll still be able to see farther than most.</p><p>There is a lot of material on good software management out there, and not everybody took the time to read all the important one. This material can sometimes be contradictory, and sometimes false. Nevertheless, I decided to integrate it here into what I’ve perceived and concluded to be the best choices.</p><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="intro-sources" class="title">Sources from Which the Advice was Taken</h5></header><p>This is a non-exhaustive list of major sources of influence.</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p><a class="link" href="http://www.catb.org/esr/">Eric S.

See for example his <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/GuerrillaInterviewing3.html">“Guerilla Guide to Interviewing”</a>. Bad programmers will create code that’s buggy, insecure, hard-to-maintain, etc. The so-called “Medium-level techs” will probably not, but will be heavily under-productive in comparison to star programmers. (And according to <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooks'_law">Brooks’ Law</a>, you can’t effectively replace one good programmer with many worse ones.)</p><p>As I noted <a class="link" href="http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?joel.3.197867.7">there are many aspects that qualify someone as a good programmer</a>. However, it does not change the fact that hiring a large number of mediocre programmers will never be as effective as hiring one or two good or very good programmers.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h5 id="openness" class="title">Openness</h5></header><p>One of the most important trends in the software world recently was towards “openness”: open-source, open-content, open-specifications, etc. Most good programmers you can find will find the open source (also known as “Free Software”) movement very appealing, and share some of its ideals. I don’t propose you should make your software open-source, although, of course, this is often a good business model. However, there are other aspects of openness that you should follow if you want to attract and keep good programmers.</p><p>First of all, don’t over protect your code. Make it open-source if possible, give your contractors and consultants (including outsource ones) access to it, and allow your programmers to show parts of it to their online friends to get some advice. You should make as much of it as possible public, under <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source_license">open source licences</a> to allow it to be used more often, increase its quality, and grow a culture around it. From my experience, working on “shrinkwrap” software that is used by end-users in the wild, and open-source software in particular, is the best way to increase the <a class="link" href="http://www.shlomifish.org/philosophy/computers/high-quality-software/">quality of the software</a> as it requires the most discipline to work on and support.</p><p>Openness does not end at that. Another important aspect is to allow your programmers to tell their friends and family about what they do. Some defence-related companies seem to think keeping everything confidential is a good idea, but that will cause your employees to feel unnecessarily trapped and unable to get help. So if you want to attract the best programmers, make sure they can tell other people of what they do, and what problems they are facing.

My friend once told me that in his previous workplace they kept a knowledge-base as a group of Microsoft Word documents stored inside a Visual SourceSafe repository.

At a certain time I needed to register at a site, to download the latest version of a PHP library, that was open-source software, because the download required authentication . There didn’t seem to be anything better.</p><p>I was told that they would prefer to write everything in PHP, because they expected to hire only PHP programmers, possibly without any Perl experience.</p><p>That wasn’t all. They also decided against using <a class="link" href="http://www.postfix.org/">Postfix</a>, which is a modern, high-performance and open-source SMTP server, and instead preferred the old Sendmail SMTP server which has a far worse reputation, and an arcane configuration system.</p><p>Furthermore, they also decided to use MySQL instead of PostgreSQL, and we ran into a PHP misbehaviour (which was fixable given a lot of PHP know-how) that made us have to restart the connection to the server after every request. Both MySQL and Sendmail were chosen due to political reasons.</p><p>With my PHP code barely working and prone to many errors, I decided to quit after about a month, out of being appalled by the bad code craftsmanship I had achieved there. Make sure you don’t repeat such a mistake.</p></section></section><div class="footnotes"><br/><hr class="footnote-hr"/><div id="ftn.pair-programming-and-code-review" class="footnote"><p><a href="#pair-programming-and-code-review" class="para"><sup class="para">[CodeReview] </sup></a>Pair programming is still not a substitute for code reviews by people who didn’t directly write the code.

Among other things, Spolsky says there that every support request needs to be fixed twice: first of all by providing a fix or a workaround for the customer, and secondly by implementing a permanent fix in the product, the web-site or whatever, to prevent your establishment from ever getting such requests again.</p><p>In addition to what Spolsky says there, I should note that you should provide help in as many channels as possible: from telephone to E-mail to <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC (Internet Relay Chat)</a> to providing your own web forums and mailing lists for help, etc. In order to prevent over-engineering and unnecessary forward-planning I would recommend implementing them when there turns out to be a demand for them, and to allow your establishment to grow organically. As <a class="link" href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/ar01s10.html">Eric Raymond notes in “Necessary Preconditions for the Bazaar Style”</a> (part of his the “Cathedral and the Bazaar” essay) it is necessary for the first released version of a successful open-source project to be good enough for people to run it, play with it, comment on it and find it useful. Similarly, when creating a commercial product, one should create customer service channels incrementally as they are needed.</p><p>A particularly bad example of an awful tech support incident is <a class="link" href="http://community.livejournal.com/shlomif_hsite/11327.html">the suspension of my former Google AdSense account</a>. On April, 2009, I was informed that my Google AdSense account was disabled because it caused a “significant risk to Google’s AdWords advertisers”, and from then on I could not log in to my account to get help. After I filled and submitted an appeal form, I received no reply after a month. Another appeal I sent did not get any response either. I next tried the Google AdSense support forum and received some replies from people who were not Google employees, that did not seem like a likely cause for an account termination, and no reply from an AdSense employee. After I talked with a few Google employees I know trying to reach someone in AdSense, one of them told me they did not know how to contact anyone in AdSense so they’ll likely going to be of little assistance. (Which is a big red flag in itself, indicating that Google has become too disparate and inefficient.)</p><p>A somewhat better, but still bad incident was with the <a class="link" href="http://sharethis.com/">ShareThis.com button</a> that I installed in my site. After they started using Google Analytics in their re-usable widget (which I didn’t want), I wrote a support request and was replied with a laconic E-mail that only said: <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">At this time, there is no way to disable our widget from accessing Google Analytics.</span>”</span>. The problem with this is that they are likely to receive the same complaint from other users like me, and so will have to reply times and again, instead of fixing the underlying problem, like Spolsky suggested. I myself have decided to move away from ShareThis and others are likely to follow suit.</p><p>And for a change, I was provided a good support by <a class="link" href="http://github.com/">Github</a>, which is a popular software-development hub. At one point, I got an announcement that my own copy of a formerly public version control repository was deleted, because the now private repository has been deleted as well. I did not want it and so went on the github IRC channel, and asked for help. I was told it was probably a bug and was asked to file a support request, which <a class="link" href="http://support.github.com/discussions/repos/2359-public-fork-of-a-formerly-public-repository-was-deleted-without-my-consent">I did</a>. There it was acknowledged that this was a bug, and I was offered a workaround that worked.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="weekly-reports" class="title">Weekly Reports and Other Ways to Keep Track of Your Employees</h4></header><p>Often your employees will run into problems and may be too shy or not have enough initiative to communicate them to you. If kept unchecked, this may lead to frustration, feelings of being trapped or worse. Here are some effective ways I found to avoid such issues, based on my experience from some of my previous workplaces.</p><p>The first is to ask every employer to submit <span class="bold"><strong>a weekly report</strong></span>: of what they have accomplished that week, what they plan to finish the next week, which problems they have run into, and what help they think they need. This report can be sent to their manager or supervisor, but they should feel free to send a carbon copy to their peers.</p><p>Another method that I came up with, is to have an interactive multi-way Internet-based channel/“chat-room” where all the team’s employees can talk and chat. This can be implemented using a dedicated <a class="link" href="http://perl-begin.org/irc/">IRC (= Internet Relay Chat)</a>, using <a class="link" href="http://xmpp.org/">the more modern XMPP protocol</a>, and possibly using such dedicated proprietary solutions such as <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Workplace">the now disbanded “IBM Workplace”</a>. By chatting online about their work (and other stuff) and keeping logs of the conversations, one can get a feel for what the employees are feeling.</p><p>Finally, it is a good idea to try to ask your employees once in a while what they feel or if they’ve run into any problems. Often, a different person can provide a fresh perspective on how to things and come up with creative solutions for how to solve their problems.</p><p>Naturally, I’m not suggesting going to extremes such as monitoring your employees every move (as Joel Spolsky notes in <a class="link" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/TwoStories.html">his “Two Stories” (about Microsoft and Juno) essay</a>), much less installing <a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystroke_logging">keystroke loggers</a> or otherwise violating your employees’ privacy. But it would be a good idea to keep abreast of the problems they run into and see how you can solve them.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="conclusion" class="title">Conclusion</h4></header><p>Not all the possible advice on how to manage a workplace was covered here. I refer you to the links at the beginning and inside the document for more reading. You should read them and be enlightened.</p><p>The workplace I’m talking about is a workplace that aims to employ great programmers to work on great projects, which your developers will love to do. It’s not meant for a sweat-shop or one of those companies working on all these low-quality applications for internal-use, especially those that are developed by or for large organisations.</p><p>If you want to hire the top developers, you should aim for a top environment and very good conditions.</p><p>I don’t intend this document to be dogma, but rather to provoke clear thinking of the matter. A lot of bright programmers I’ve talked with about the vision of a perfect workplace, have claimed that this is an non-achievable fantasy, and that all employers are much more clueless than that. However, while perfection can never be achieved, I’ve seen my share of good workplaces, and benevolent and clueful employers, and I think many of them are enlightened enough to improve according to my suggestions.</p><p>It’s not necessary for a programmer to be a wage slave - they need to be treated much better than that, if their employer wants them to be productive and happy. I hope this essay explained how.</p></section><section class="section"><header xmlns:h="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="titlepage"><h4 id="thanks" class="title">Thanks</h4></header><p>Thanks to <a class="link" href="http://jnw.name/">firespeaker</a> for going over an early version of this article and providing some corrections.</p></section></section><footer/></div><h2 id="other_formats">Other Formats</h2><ul><li><a href="perfect-it-workplace-v2.pdf">Acrobat Reader (PDF) Format</a> (You are allowed to print it, but please don’t.)</li><li><a href="perfect-it-workplace-v2.xml">Original DocBook/XML</a>.</li><li><a href="perfect-it-workplace-v2.rtf">Word RTF</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="coverage">Coverage</h2><p><b>TODO :</b> fill in.</p><script>shlomif_load_nav("philosophy/computers/software-management/perfect-workplace/v2/content.html");</script><p class="share"><a href="http://www.addtoany.com/share_save?linkurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.shlomifish.org%2Fphilosophy%2Fcomputers%2Fsoftware-management%2Fperfect-workplace%2Fv2%2Fcontent.html&amp;linkname="><img src="../../../../../images/share_save_171_16.png" width="171" height="16" class="bless" alt="Share/Bookmark"/></a><br/></p></main><nav class="navbar" id="navbar"><div class="center"><a href="../../../../../" title="Shlomi Fish’s Homepage"><img src="../../../../../images/evilphish-svg.min.svg" alt="EvilPHish by Illiad" class="highlight" style="border:0;margin-bottom:.5em"/></a></div><ul class="nav_links"><li><img src="../../../../../images/arrow-2-left-disabled.png" alt="Previous Page" class="bless"/></li><li><img src="../../../../../images/arrow-2-up-disabled.png" alt="Up in the Site" class="bless"/></li><li><a href="../../../../../" title="Next Page (Alt+N)" accesskey="n"><img src="../../../../../images/arrow-2-right.png" alt="Next Page" class="bless"/></a></li></ul><div id="nav_menu"><ul><li><a href="../../../../../">Shlomi Fish’s Homepage</a></li><li class="open"><a href="../../../../../me/">About Myself</a><br/><ul><li><a href="../../../../../personal.html" title="A Short Biography of Myself">Bio</a><br/><ul><li><a href="../../../../../me/intros/" title="Introductions of Me to Various Forums">Intros</a><br/><ul><li><a href="../../../../../me/intros/writers/" title="My Intro to the MIT Writers Mailing List">MIT Writers</a></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><a href="../../../../../me/contact-me/" title="How to Contact Me">Contact Me</a></li><li><a href="../../../../../me/rindolf/" title="The history and etymology of “Rindolf”, Shlomi Fish’s Nickname">“Rindolf” -
