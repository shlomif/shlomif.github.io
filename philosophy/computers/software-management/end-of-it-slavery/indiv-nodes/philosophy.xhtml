Another element is philosophy. I&#8217;m not talking about the standard ivory-tower philosophy, which is mostly either useless or completely harmful, but rather of the process of &#8220;loving-the-wisdom&#8221; and seeking wisdom. Nowadays, most of the greatest philosophers don&#8217;t write books. Instead they write essays and articles online, emails, weblog entries or comments, or even cartoon strips or other art forms. The great philosophers of today are bloggers.</p><p>Some great programmers I know purposely maintain a low profile and don&#8217;t comment on everything. I can respect that. Others (including the writer of these lines) are completely sincere and always express their mind.</p><p>If you want to tell if someone is a great developer - ask him about his opinion on a few things. Possibly political. Possibly related to software management. Possibly something less serious, like popular culture. If they&#8217;re a great developer, they&#8217;ll eventually have something innovative and opinionated to say about something. Not necessarily an opinion you&#8217;ll agree with, but a good, well-thought opinion.</p><p>When asked why he changed his opinion from the day before, Mahatma Gandhi replied: &#8220;Yesterday I was more stupid.&#8221;. And indeed, you&#8217;ll see that the really good programmers may eventually change their opinions.</p></section></main>
