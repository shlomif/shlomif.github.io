Many workplaces don&#8217;t understand that.</p><p>In a previous workplace of mine, I was given a recycled computer - it was still fast but its hard-disk was only 40 GB. It was a pain to get some Windows XP virtual machines running there. Another computer we developed on still had a 40 GB hard disk too. We ran out of space there because we had a huge checkout of the <a class="link" href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion version control system</a> there. And the only hard-disks that our lab had were whopping 80 GB ones, bought because they were the cheapest ones, which probably wouldn&#8217;t have been sufficient for too long, either.</p><p>The most amazing thing was that the computer&#8217;s sole CD drive, was just a CD drive - no CD writing, no DVD reading or writing - a CD drive. It gave me a lot of grief. I had to copy a few DVDs I burned at home on my supervisor&#8217;s computer, and copy them over the network, and could not install a Linux distribution from its installation DVD even if I wanted to.</p><p>Some people can still happily use old hardware or play with relatively buggy software. But good developers should not be concerned with this. They want a hardware with enough space, RAM, and processing power. They want a screen that they can easily move around (a flat-panel LCD screen). They want good food in the kitchen. They want talkative, interesting and benevolent people to talk with. They want a spacious office. They <a class="link" href="http://www.fysh.org/~katie/computing/no-net-access.txt">want Internet connectivity</a> so they can surf the web and search for answers, chat with their friends, ask people on the IRC for help, and contact some people who know more about the software they are using than they do.</p></section></main>
